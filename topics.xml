                <text>Building an Electric C'arriage.
                    A novelty among vehlieles in this
                    country, an electric carriage, is now

                    of a similar carriage in nresent use in
                    London. The battery contains thirty.
                    two cells,aoid is jplaced in the rear end
                    of the body of 4ileo carriage. The
                    motor, which is of foreign manutfao
                    ture, rests between the hitd springs,
                    where it is attached to the body by
                    two hinge clasps in such a manner as
                    to allow it to swing when the motion
                    of the carriage is irregular, although
                    this swing is regulated by a connect
                    ing rod. The driving shfts of the

                    PAVEMENTS MADE FROM OAK AND ICON
                    An electrical carriage has been shipped to
                    Chicago from Des Moines, Iowa. It may
                    arrive to-day, and as soon as its storage bat
                    teries can be charged it will be sent spin
                    ning alont; the boulevards. It was built for
                    ordinary usage and it is said to have carried
                    12 people at a speed ot 14 miles an hour
                    and can run continuously for 13 hours be
                    fore the energy is exhausted. The motor
                    ued is rated at four-horse power, and
                    has an armature of the Siemens type with
                    special-wound coils. The prominent feature
                    of the carriage is the storage cells, 24 in
                    number placed in three sets of eight each.
                    The weight is said to be but 32 pounds per
                    cell audio yield three-horse power hours of
                    energy per cell.
                    The carriage ha a special gearing and a
                    ball and socket motion to the axle, while a
                    peculiar hub device allows for any obstacles
                    encountered. The motor is carried by a
                    framework underneath the body of the car
                    riage and is geared to the rear axle. The
                    steering device is attached to the front uf
                    the axle and is controlled bv a handwheel in
                    the front of the carriage. It is said to be
                    so delicate in action that the course of the
                    chicle can be altered bv a slight touch.
                    The switch for throwing the motor in and
                    out ot circuit is moved by the foot of the
                    one in charge. This carriage is said to have
                    ascended grades or 17 per cent without
                    severe strains.</text>

                <text>Wagons May Now Be Run by
                    Electricity.
                    Chicago, Aug, 10.— A novelty in the
                    way of a wagon propelled by electricity
                    was seen on the streets of Chicago yes
                    terday. Some time ago President J. B.
                    McDonald, of the American Battery
                    company, purchased several patents
                    from William Morrison, of Dcs Moines.
                    Among other things was a park wagon
                    equipped with a small three-horse-power
                    motor and twenty-four-cell storage bat
                    tery. Yesterday Mr. McDonald fitted
                    the wagon with new batteries and gave
                    it a trial. With five persons in the
                    wagon it left the barn on Monroe
                    street and traveled to the company's
                    office. The run was made in twenty
                    two minutes, which was considered a
                    satisfactory, considering that the wagon
                    was delayed at a bridge and that fre
                    quent stops were, made on account of
                    the crowds in the streets down town.
                    It is calculated that the wagon can
                    make ten miles an hour easily with the
                    present motor and can climb any bill in
                    the city.</text>

                    The flfty-four-mile motocycle race for
                    prizes offered by the Chicago Times-Herald,

                    never been equaled in the history of mechan
                    ical progress. In June of this year per

                    not start out with the idea of winning the
                    race. They were unable to arrange for sup

                    As already stated lie The Star, the Duryea
                    wagon won. The following is the story of
                    the Duryea's trip from Chicago to Evans
                    ton and back, as told, by A. W. White, Its
                    umpire:
                    "We left tho barn at 7:15 a.m. and went
                    with our own power to the starting point.
                    At 8:15 tbe start was made and we ran
                    without a stop to the corner of Erie antl
                    Rush streets. Here we broke our steering
                    gear ty running over a high crossing cov
                    ered with snow. A wait of fifty-five minutes
                    ensued. From this point we ran to Evans
                    ton without a stop, arriving there at 12*33
                    o'clock. On the return we were delayed four
                    minutes In Chicago avenue, Evanston, by a
                    sleigh that had tipped over In the street.
                    Cortlnuing, we got Into the wrong road on
                    account of the absence of a sign at the
                    corner of Lawrence avenue and Clark street.
                    We ran down Clark to Diversey street be
                    fore discovering cur mistake. Then we
                    went up Diversey to Lincoln avenue and on
                    Lincoln avenue to Roscoe street, where we
                    resumed the correct route. I estimate the
                    extra distance traversed at two miles, ap
                    proximate. While on Diversey near Clark
                    we broke our 'sparker,' and spent fifty-five
                    minutes repairing it. At 3:10 we resumed
                    the journey.
                    "We wore delayed fifteen minutes at
                    Drake avenue and Central Park boulevard
                    to adjust the machinery and to take fuel.
                    Another delay of four minutes occurred at
                    the Fort Wayne crossing of SRth street
                    boulevard. The delay at the second relay
                    was ten minutes. Numerous slight delays
                    of a minute or so I have not mentioned.
                    "Three and one-half gallons of gasoline
                    and nineteen gallons of water were con
                    sumed. No power outside the vehicle was
                    tsed. I estimate that enough power was
                    used to run the motor 190 miles over smooth
                    rof.ds. We finished at 7:18 and ran back to
                    10th street with our own power. Our cor
                    rected time was seven hours and fifty-three
                    minutes."
                    Description of the Daryen.
                    The carriage which Jed in the race Is the
                    result of three years' Inventive effort on the
                    part of Charles E. Duryea of Peoria, 111. It
                    weigs 700 pounds and can attain a speed of
                    twenty miles an hour. On good roads it has
                    already reached even a higher rate of speed.
                    Its motor Is a four-horse power engine and
                    weighs 120 pounds. The diameter of the
                    front wheels Is 34 Inches; of the rear wheels
                    3S inches. Only five minutes is required in
                    replenishing its fuel supply. The arrange
                    ment of the gearing is such that the car
                    riage can be made to run from three to six
                    teen miles an hour, and the gradation from
                    the minimum to the maximum degree of
                    lotation is accomplished without the motor
                    changing its rate of speed, the pressing of a
                    button effecting this object.
                    The axletrees of the carriage are fixed to
                    the body, dividing at the ends into vertical
                    forks, into which are fitted pieces like ordi
                    nary carriage hubs In shape, which hold the
                    axle. Bolts run through these pieces, and a
                    connecting rod of iron, extending back of the
                    axletrce and joined at the center of the
                    wagon with the steering device, makes the
                    separately swung wheels work together.
                    The lateral movement of the lever turns
                    the wheels, and the vertical movement
                    starts or stops, changes the rate of speed
                    and reverses Its movements, driving it back
                    ward when desired. Ball joints and ball
                    bearings minimize all effort and friction and
                    minimizes the power used. The brake drum
                    Is urder the seat and Is controlled by a wire
                    with a button at the front corner of the seat
                    by which, under a speed of twelve) miles an
                    hour, the vehicle can be stopped in a few
                    feet.
                    By the proper arrangement of gears, cones
                    and levers, a change of speed is instantly ef
                    fected hy the vertical movement of the lever.
                    In this machine the steering heads are
                    placed as close as possible to the wheels,
                    and at the same time are so angled that
                    their line strikes the plane of the wheel at
                    just the point a stone or other obstruction
                    would naturally be encountered. This does
                    away with the leverage, which tends to turn
                    the wheel by breaking the force along the
                    line of the head.
                    Among the advantages elalmeel for the
                    Duryea machine, are, little noise or odor,
                    excellent springs, four speeds -five, ten and
                    twenty miles an hour forward, and three
                    miles an hour backward; can be quickly
                    geared to different speeels: can be run at
                    any speed desired below its limit; its fuel
                    costs less than one-half cent per mile. It car
                    ries eight gallons of fuel; runs from 100 to
                    200 miles without refilling; has self-oiling
                    motors and bearings: will not jerk the levers
                    out of the driver's hand, and is not danger
                    ous either from fire or explosion.

                    much of a success that the company
                    operating them has just given out an
                    order for 100 new vehicles. Daring
                    Jane, the first moath of their operation,
                    a total number of 632 calls were
                    received, averaging between thirty-Wb
                    and twelve per day, carrying 1680 passengers
                    4603 miles at rates similar to
                    the horse-cab system, and each month
                    sinoe that time has seen a steady increase
                    in the service.
                    The best resalts obtained from these
                    vehicles show that about -1.25 horsepower
                    is supplied for a propulsion of
                    2000 pounds over ordinarily level roads
                    at a speed of ten miles an hour. This
                    consumption of power is a trifle over
                    two and one-third times that of similar
                    work on rails, which indicates that the

                    der what sort of animal Equus cabal
                    lus really was and will marvel at the
                    Ca< t that he was once harnessed and
                        made to haul heavy loads.
                        The beginning: of the end was in sight
                        when electricity first supplanted the
                        horse as a means of propulsion for
                        street cars. Then the bicycle came,
                    sprang at once into popular favor and
                    rendered still more limited the' uses of
                    our once essential quadruped.
                    But now stili greater changes are
                    taking place. The introduction of the
                    automobile on streets of American cit
                    ies is slowly but surely driving out the
                    old fashioned hansom and the two horse
                    orougham, and now even the lorrie team
                    and the long overworked draft horse
                    are to become "things that were."
                    The recent formation of a company in
                    New York city with a capital of some
                    $100,000,000 to exploit compressed air as
                    a motive power for all trucking and
                    carting business in Greater New York !
                    shows still again how surely the reign j
                    of the horse is passing away. He will
                    of course continue, for a time at least,
                    to remain the pet and the trained speed
                    ing animal of the wealthy in the city
                    and the helpful friend of the more hum
                    ble farmer in the country. But as time
                    goes on and urban population becomes
                    more and more dense it will be seen, to
                    be even more necessary in order to ob
                    viate congestion of traffic in city streets
                    and to maintain a proper degree of san
                    itation and cleanliness to allow only
                    self propelling- vehicles on the public
                    streets of our towns and cities.
                    The outcome of this will be a vast
                    Improvement in the condition and
                    smoothness of all city streets, the abo
                    lition of the objectionable cobblestone
                    is paving material and the elimination
                    of the ear piercing noises which now
                    make a pandemonium of the average
                    metropolitan thoroughfare.
                    It is true, motor vehicles for pleasure,
                    traffic and business purposes have been
                    somewhat slow of adoption in this coun
                    try. The horse has held his own here
                    with remarkable pertinacity, for it has
                    been in European cities, and particular
                    ly in Paris, that the automobile indus
                    try has flourished to the greatest ex
                    tent. The principal reason why Ameri
                    cans have been in no undue haste to
                    sulopt motor carriages re the fact that
                    mechanically these have not hitherto
                    been sufficiently developed to render
                    them acceptable for general use. The
                    motive power employed in most of them
                    has been unsatisfactory because of lack
                    of efficiency in some cases and extrava
                    gant expense of operation in others.
                    But American brains and American en
                    ergy have been at work on the problem
                    for the last few years, with the result
                    that the objections referred to have
                    been practically removed.
                    The general public, as a rule, has not
                    the opportunity of seeing the gradual
                    ;:!:ti laborious approach to perfection of
                    any important mechanical invention.
                    This same general public is usually as
                    tounded at the miraculous appearance
                    i ! some new wonder, while the men
                    who have been laboring for years to
                    bring about this apparent mechanical
                    miracle foresaw the inevitable long be
                    fore the busy world had thought of such
                    a ihing. For some time now jokes have
                    been made about the passing of the
                    horse, but until the last year or so it
                    was never really thought that the pe
                    riod of equine usefulness had so nearly
                    approached its close.
                    It was vaguely felt that changes
                    might come about in time, for the idea
                    of mechanical instead of animal trac
                    tion power is as old as the history of
                    human thought itself. Even Homer
                    himself describes the god Vulcan as be
                    ing engaged upon the construction of
                    a great hall on wheels, which he de
                    .-cubes as "self moving and wonderful,"
                    and Juno is made to command Vulcan
                    to create tripods which shall run by
                    ■•■!v<>s. thus rendering better serv
                    !ce to the gods in their meetings on
                    Mount Olympus.
                    in the thirteenth century the English
                    philosopher Roger Bacon wrote in one
                    of his works. "They will make carriages
                    which will run with the greatest imag
                    inable swiftness without any harnessed
                    whatever."
                    The earliest horseless carriage which is
                    preserved today is one now on exhibition
                    in Paris at the Conservatoire dcs Artes
                    et Metiers. This machine was invented
                    by Cugnot in 1769 and was made to op
                    erate by steam, the energy of which
                    was applied through two perpendicular
                    piston tubes. The principal reason per- j
                    haps why the French steam automobile
                    was not brought to a state of compara
                    tive perfection during the last century
                    was the beginning of the revolution.
                    The turbulence which accompanied that
                    event naturally turned men's minds
                    from .peaceful and civilizing pursuits to I
                    thoughts of warfare and the deposing of 1
                    NUGGETS FROM EVERYWHERE.
                    Senator Simon of Oregon has been
                    taking banjo lessons. "Are you improv
                    ing?" some one asked him recently.
                    "J'.wh'T tl*it or the neighbors are get
                    ting inure used to it," he replied.
                    f>n ,in occasion a bishop was consol

                    I j l l to son. The poor fellow was rocking
                    tf. and fro in his distress. He suddenly

                    running down his cheeks, said, "D'ye

                    The late Senator Morrill, though he
                    monarchs. But it was in all likelihood
                    from the Cugnot steam carriage that i
                    Stephenson indirectly obtained his idea j
                    ! for a locomotive on rails.
                    j At the Exposition Universelle in Paris
                    I in 187S a steam automobile was exhibit-
                    I ed very like that of Cugnot, the only
                    j difference being that the frame of. the
                    j more modern vehicle was built after the !
                    J plan of a common road carriage and not
                    jas a velocipede. This automobile, how- I
                    ever, was not a very satisfactory ma- j
                    chine, and it was not until 12 years later
                    that MM. Serpollet and Archdeacon in- i
                    vented a steam automobile, with which j
                    they journeyed from Paris to L.yons in ]
                    ten days. In 1894 the automobile first
                    gave promise of actual adaptability for j
                    general transportation and traction j
                    purposes. In that year the editor of the
                    Petit Journal organized the first auto
                    mobile race, which was run from Paris j
                    to Rouen. In this contest the steam ;
                    horseless carriage, while proving itself
                    cumbersome, noisy and uncouth in ap
                    pearance, showed itself superior to its
                    electrical and gasoline propelled rivals
                    of that time. The following year an
                    other race was run, this time from Paris
                    to Bordeaux and return, but in this test
                    it was the electrical carriage that prov
                    ed itself the superior machine.
                    Up to this time the construction of
                    these carriages had been conducted
                    along the ugly lines of a buggy or four
                    wheeled cart instead of seeking an in
                    | dividuality for themselves through de
                    j signs more fitting to their peculiar qual
                    | ities. Today, however, it might be said
                    that they have evolved an individuality
                    of their own. Automobile mechanics is
                    an art the nicety of which is only un
                    derstood by those who are of the pro
                    fession.
                    But one of the great difficulties that
                    still face the constructors of horseless
                    carriages is the problem of expense. A
                    Parisian made automobile victoria, for
                    instance, costs some $800 and an auto
                    mobile tricycle $300. The heavier car
                    riages are proportionately expensive.
                    This costliness of manufacture, how
                    ever, is a drawback that time will put
                    right,- just as has been the case with
                    the bicycle. But while the initial outlay
                    for an automobile Is still very large this
                    is more than compensated for by the in
                    significant extent of operating expenses,
                    the fuel for the petroleum propelled ye-
                    hides costing merely 1% cents per hour.
                    The development of the automobile as
                    a thing of beauty will take place only
                    when its place is assured and its use is
                    general, when people of means and
                    fashion will begin to demand certain
                    characteristics of design and finish to
                    differentiate their carriages from the
                    vehicles of the livery and the cab stand.
                    There are a number of New York la-

                    Congressional Record than any of his
                    colleagues, always made a speech early
                    in the session and sent a copy bound
                    in Russia leather to every senator and
                    a paper bound copy to every voter In
                    Vermont.
                    Congressman Elect John L. Burnett
                    of Alabama, who will probably be the
                    smallest man in the next house, is an
                    able lawyer. When he first appeared
                    before the supreme court of Alabama
                    to argue a case, he stood up behind a
                    high bench on which lawyers were ac

                    dies who have their own private auto
                    mobiles and may be seen any day
                    speeding noiselessly along the more
                    fashionable streets of that city. It takes
                    some skill and experience to operate
                    one of these powerful horseless car
                    riages, for, after all, they are mere lo
                    comotives and not unconnected with
                    danger in the hands of the inexperi
                    enced. In Paris the authorities require
                    each operator of an automobile to pass
                    a practical examination, after which
                    he is given a certificate of efficiency.
                    The local history of Paris, neverthe
                    less, .for the past two years has been
                    lively enough with runaways, collisions,
                    upsets and explosions of a more or less
                    serious nature. New York has also had
                    its list of little accidents.
                    There is one thing that the motor car
                    riage demands, and that is good roads.
                    We are already indebted to the bicycle
                    for an improvement in the condition of
                    our highways, but when the automobile
                    comes into general use both the great
                    unthinking public and governmental
                    bodies will become impressed with' the
                    necessity for a better class of roadmak
                    ing. As things now are, the United
                    States stands lowest on the list of ad
                    vanced countries in the matter of good
                    highways. Another advantage of the
                    use of the horseless vehicle will be that
                    our streets will be found more health-
                    customed to lay their books and pa

                    addressing this court."
                    jOn a recently bitterly cold night
                    Speaker Reed had occasion to ride on a
                    street car the conductor of which neg
                    ligently left the door open, to the great
                    discomfort of the passengers. Mr. Reed
                    beckoned to the railway official and
                    when the latter came inside asked,
                    "Why have you got your collar turned
                    up, my friend?" "It's mighty cold," re
                    sponded the conductor, "and I want to
                    keep warm." "So do the rest of us,"

                    | lation and no popular prejudice against
                    I the automobile, as in England, for in
                    : stance, where only a little over a year
                    i ago prohibitory legislation with regard
                    ! to the use of such carriages in London
                    | was repealed. Until this action was
                    ; taken it was necessary that all horse
                    ' less carriages should be preceded by a
                    man on foot or on horseback bearing a
                    I red flag as a warning of the approach
                    of the terrible engine of destruction.
                    Animal power has ever been capri
                    cious and uncertain, while machinery is
                    j reliable and always sure. An automo
                    ' bile does not require continual atten-
                    tion, as does an animal. While not in
                    use the automobile entails no operating
                    expenses, and all that can be charged
                    to its idleness is the interest on the
                    original outlay for its purchase. Nor
                    will it grow old and die, like a horse.
                    When its day's work is done, it can be
                    run into a shed and stand there until
                    once more called upon to do service.
                    So long as it remaijis one of the deep
                    rooted characteristics of man, the most
                    restless of all animals, to be in the
                    place where he is not he will see to it
                    that his means of transportation are as
                    expedient, inexpensive and comfortable
                    as circumstances will permit. It has
                    taken him some time to reach the age
                    of the automobile, but it might be said
                    that such an age has at last arrived.
                    The passing of the horse furnishes
                    food for much profound thought and
                    reflection. It is a farreaching question, j
                    affecting almost all kinds and condi
                    tions of men. What will become of the
                    smith who hitherto eked out his frugal
                    existence in the wayside village under
                    the spreading chestnut tree? What will
                    become of the hay and feed man who
                    has so long and so profitably catered to
                    the inner wants of our old time equine
                    friend? What will become of the farm
                    er and his hay crop and his field of
                    oats? What will become of the costly
                    livery stable and the harness maker and
                    the veterinary surgeon?
                    It is no easy matter to figure out the
                    Immediate or even the ultimate im
                    provement in the general condition of
                    affairs which will result from the adop-
                    observed the speaker. "Suppose you
                    shut the door!" It is needless to add
                    that the passengers were comfortable
                    during the remainder of the trip.
                    A characteristic of the late William
                    Black was his ignorance of his own
                    books, and it was very difficult to get
                    him to talk about his novels. It seem
                    ed that as soon as the proof sheets were
                    returned to the printers Mr. Black for
                    got all about his own creations, "in
                    talking to my husband the other day,"
                    Mrs. Black once said fto a visitor, "I
                    suddenly remembered an anecdote in
                    one of his novels which illustrated what
                    I was saying. Mr. Black laughed hearti
                    ly at the story and then turned eagerly
                    lion of the horseless carriage, when it
                    is borne in mind that many disturbing
                    elements enter into the problem. Al
                    ] ready there has been a great falling oft
                    : in the production ef horses and a depre
                    ciation in the value of horseflesh, which
                    i has filled the farmer and the horse
                    breeder with apprehension. But, for
                    tunately, these questions have the habit
                    jof settling and adjusting themselves.
                    j When it is remembered that there are
                    j now millions of acres of land devoted to
                    | the growing of crops for horse food
                    ! alone, which in time may and must be
                    I devoted to the production of food for
                    I the human beings who are engaged in
                    ! the manufacture of the very machines
                    ' that are displacing the horse, the prob
                    lem is not so intricate and the outlook
                    is not so dark as it at first seems.
                    The poor old cab horse has always
                    had his drawbacks as a working ma
                    chine, and even with an animal en
                    dowed with all the noble attributes of
                    I the horse the question of economics can
                    ■ not be kept out of the calculation. It
                    costs at least 60 cents a day to keep the
                    | ordinary steed that travels up and down
                    a city's streets, and if he chances to be
                    a cab horse and times are good he will
                    I travel about 25 miles, on an average, on
                    | that amount of nourishment. But he re
                    j quires at least eight hours' sleep and
                    rest, to say nothing of an occasional
                    | day off as a result of colic, which leaves
                    I him a working capacity of 16 hours.
                    : Most of the time, however, he spends in
                    j loafing around on street corners and
                    dreamily digesting his 60 cents' worth
                    of oats and hay.
                    It is commonly supposed that all cab
                    horses live about 100 years, but this is
                    one of those popular errors which have
                    no actual foundation in fact. His ten
                    ure of life averages, appearances to the
                    ; contrary, about 15 years, and at 60 cents
                    a day His feed in that time will amount
                    to only $3,275, for which, if he has
                    led an industrious, sober and unpam
                    pered life, he covers some 109,500 miles.
                    This newfangled automobile that is
                    elbowing its four footed rival off the
                    streets of the city, on the other hand,
                    will travel the same distance for about
                    $1,000, expended in fuel or electricity,
                    and while doing so will never have to
                    be sent to the blacksmith shop to be
                    shod, the average cost of repairs being
                    no more than that for the ordinary car
                    riage hauled by horses.
                    A French writer who has made a
                    study of the horseless carriage a spe
                    cialty has been figuring out its ultimata
                    to me, 'But where did you hear so good
                    a story?' My husband wouldn't be
                    lieve it was in one of his own books
                    until I found it for him."
                    Senator Frye of Maine says that
                    while in Paris he needed a hair cut, so
                    he studied carefully the necessary por
                    tion of his "French Conversation Book"
                    and did his best to make the barber
                    understand. "I don't understand Dutch,"
                    said the person addressed. "Do you
                    speak English?"
                    A good story is told by Rudyard Kip
                    ling at his own expense. During his
                    stay in Wiltshire, England, one sum
                    mer he met little Dorothy Drew, Mr.
                    Gladstone's granddaughter, and, being
                    possibilities and prophesying as to its
                    future.
                    He forecasts that the size of the auto
                    mobile, while not yet greatly differing
                    from the ordinary one or two horse
                    wagon, will increase in time to an enor
                    mous extent and that its weight may
                    even reach a Vegister of thousands of
                    ; tons. The liveryman will be replaced
                    by the dispenser of coal, electricity and
                    1 petroleum, and instead of water troughs
                    1 along the principal highways there will
                    be seen innumerable electric storage de
                    ' pots.
                    This French prophet attempts to
                    straighten out the economic knot by
                    1 forecasting that the horse will in time
                    ' become a delectable and much sought
                    after feod animal. He holds that a life
                    of leisure will restore the proper amount
                    of succulence to the flesh of the now ]
                    overworked quadruped, and that a time
                    will come when horse steaks will be
                    served at all restaurants and their con
                    sumption will be looked upon as a mat
                    ter of course. This Parisian prophet also
                    foresees the traveling shop and the itin
                    erant theater. An immense automobile
                    will carry along both actors, scenery and j
                    playhouse. On the upper floors of the
                    great wheeled building will be the
                    apartments of the company, who will
                    not have to pack and unpack their be
                    longings each day.
                    A train de luxe will become the fash
                    ionable means by which pleasure out
                    ings will be taken, and summer travel
                    ing will no longer be done on dusty and
                    crowded railway trains. A circuit court
                    will move from town to town in full
                    session on wheels, and even funeral
                    processions will consist of a number of
                    automobiles linked together like a train
                    of cars.
                    All this sounds more or less like a
                    page from a fairy tale book or the idle
                    dream of a mere visionary. It repre
                    sents, nevertheless, something far more
                    substantial, for it is the conviction of a
                    farseeing and scholarly French scien
                    tist, who has had the opportunity of
                    studying the different inventions which
                    are slowly but surely being brought to a
                    state of perfection in his own country,
                    which may well be called the birthplace
                    and the home of the horseless carriage.</text>

                    there had been much agitation in the
                    columns of the local press concerning the
                    possible danger that might result to
                    pedestrians and horse3 from the intro
                    duction of self propelling vehicles Into
                    Washington In order to prove that the
                    local press was unnecessarily alarmed
                    Mr Toss drove his automobile direct to
                    the offices of the Commissioners of the
                    District of Columbia and Invited Mr John
                    Wight then Chief Commissioner to take
                    a drive To test the safety of the ma
                    chine and the advisability of permitting
                    it to be operated in Washington Mr
                    Wight accepted the invitation and sur
                    rounded by an unexpected escort of Li
                    cyclists loafers and small boys the two
                    gentlemen made a tour ot the city
                    A Chorus of Objections
                    The appearance of the first automobile
                    naturally treated a ripple of excitement
                    Filled with curiosity pedestrians stood
                    on the curb and watched the marvelous
                    vehicle until It disappeared from sight
                    Having in mind their own interests liv
                    erymen and dealers In horses vehemently
                    declared that the new fangled machine
                    was not worth a continental and there
                    upon illogically proceeded to dispose of
                    their surplus live stock The drivers ot
                    hansom cabs piotcsted that its Introduc
                    tion was a clear infringement on their
                    constitutional rights and regretted that
                    as citizens of the District they were de
                    prived of a voice and vote In the making
                    of laws
                    One old man was overheard to say that
                    THE BALLAD OF THE AUTOMOBILE
                    Oat of the woods and Into the stress ot Gotham marts there
                    came
                    Young Timothy Hay and began straightway to dicker with
                    Life for fame
                    And he cared no whit on thrones to sit or at shrines of art
                    to kneel
                    One aim alone before him shone to possess an automobile
                    He had a scheme like an opium dream constructed on
                    Midas plan
                    To wake up the world as it never was woke since Its slow
                    old life began
                    By the wheels in his head and the wheels on his feet he
                    conned the busy I atcs
                    And slid along the road to wealth as one on roller skates
                    He bought his treasure and mounted the seat and gazed
                    across the land
                    And felt with Joy t he marveloue toy obey his untried hand
                    And when he yaw 1 he ehauffeor wait to take him all about
                    He said I know what I want to do and you mayB well
                    get out
                    The chauffeur lit with alacrity ho had seen such things
                    before
                    And the automobl le on its silent wheel sptd like the days
                    of yore
                    And lest in dream s sat Timothy until cf a sudden he
                    Became aware that his agile charge vas trying to climb a
                    tree
                    Now what he said as he felt of his head I should not like
                    to say
                    No bicscle skates or electric car had treated him that way
                    0 he sat him dovv n beside the rocd to sec what the mat
                    ter might be
                    The machine mus t be out ct order he ijoth theres
                    nothing the ma Iter with me
                    He set the siecrliis rod nor-nor-cast and physicked tho
                    running gear
                    And what he did to the gasolene tank It doth not jet ap
                    pear
                    And the hair of the horrified cows rose up as they gazul
                    across tho fence
                    Tor the air was bluo with the slzzing smoke and language
                    most intense
                    Then he hoisted the vreck on it3 limping wheels and man
                    aged to make it go
                    Though its progress was somewhat erratic and tircd llko
                    and slow
                    And people gave It nil of the road when they saw It com
                    ing by
                    Till it reached the brow of a little hill and started out
                    to lly
                    Ho pounded the brake and he cried Cecl Haw but it did
                    not understand
                    And It turned unlimited somersaults across the startled
                    land
                    But though he was tumbled upside dovn in a most unseemly
                    way
                    Nobody saw a conviction of sin shaken cut of Timothy Hay
                    He picked himself and the automobile frcifl the mud of the
                    roadside ditch
                    And ihc state of the two was such that jou could hardly
                    tell which from which
                    And he said It Is all this darnel machine as cti can
                    plainly see
                    For all my tinkering did no good and terc3 nothing the

                    c
                    There came a buzz frcm the Lattcred Tiling a he climbed
                    to his seat once mure
                    And he rose on the wings of a purple cloud and a dull and
                    smothered roar
                    For whether it wa3 that the insult biiimned its passions
                    Mtter cup
                    Or what was the matter nobody knows but that automobile
                    blew up
                    A reeking smell of gasolene went forth and smote the
                    sky
                    The automobile and Timothy went on to the by and by
                    They were subdivided so thoroughly that not till the next
                    days rain
                    Did aught descend that was recognized as relics of the

                    Now while to run an automobile Is a Joyous thii to do
                    The joy is done and no more it is fun when the sutomoblle

                <text>"There are still some people who In
                    sist that the automobile industry is a
                    mushroom growth, subject to the slight
                    est ariations in business conditions, and
                    likely to take a fatal slump on short
                    notice," remarked R. C. Smith, secretary
                    of the Overland-"Washlngton Motor Com
                    pany. Mr. Smith had Just read a report made
                    by a committee of the Chicago Associa
                    tion of Commerce.
                    'To such people," continued Smith, "I
                    can say only one thing read that rc
                    rort. There is enough information in
                    that single document to set at rest the
                    fears of even the most confirmed pessi
                    mist. The information is backed by in
                    disputable evidence of figures, too.
                    "The report shows that approximately
                    J600.000.000 will be spent in this coun
                    try during 1914, for automobiles. The
                    deVelopments of past years show that
                    the percentage of buyers who cannot af
                    ford to purchase cars Is so small as to
                    be unimportant. In view of this fact
                    the total shows a pretty good refutation
                    of the claim that arij money that might
                    better be spent for brerd 13 gointj Into

                    New York State alone has more cars
                    registered than are in use in Germany
                    and France combined, and both these
                    countries have always been regarded as
                    pioneers in the production of automo

                    that hundreds of thousands of people
                    throughout the country are making a

                    Purchasers of cars should bear in
                    mind the fact that every car has a dis
                    position. Each make of car has its own
                    peculiarities.

                    you are not entirely familiar. It Is ad
                    visable to obtain from the maker a book

                    While the progress In design has not
                    been by any means radical the builders
                    of electric cars have endeavored to ao
                    mom fnr ! Henlpr nnd the owner by a
                    system of co-operation attained by or
                    ganization. The Electric Automobile
                    Manufacturers' Association, while It has
                    been In existence for many years, never
                    has been so active as It is at present.
                    In securing among makers and dealers
                    better co-operation and In preaching
                    better selling methods. This associa
                    tion has done much good work In the
                    Held in helping tne aeaicrs oecome
                    more familiar with ideal selling meth
                    ods, thereby ultimately gaining what all
                    Beek, a minimum of loss through sales
                    and service.
                    While this organization has been very,
                    active the local electric vehicle associa
                    tions have shown their extreme willing
                    ness to bring the electric vehicle Indus
                    try to a still higher standard and most
                    of these associations have kept the car
                    owner in mind as much as they have
                    their own Interests, since the car own
                    er's welfare means much to the dealer,
                    garageman, and all connected with the
                    industry.
                    The makers In the field during 1914
                    have turned out approximately 5,000
                    cars, and If present plans are adhered
                    to the coming year will see an Increase
                    of 1,000 vehicles over the 1914 flguro.
                    With this number on the list the aver
                    age per company will bo about 300 cars.
                    The list of manufacturers of electric
                    vehicle makers, while It changes from
                    year to year, shows a total in the neigh
                    borhood of twenty, each season seeing
                    the coming In of new concerns and tho
                    passing of older ones. The past five
                    years has witnessed production by
                    thirty-five makers, yet each year there
                    there was a falling off of old and a
                    proportionate addition by new makers,
                    until now about twenty remain.
                    Aside from the progress -in the busi
                    ness side of the industry, advancement
                    has been made in engineering lines and
                    the greater use of the worm, drive prob
                    ably comes In first place. There has
                    been an Increase of over BO per cent
                    in the number of cars using this type of
                    drive. For the first time spiral-bevel
                    gears have- come into use on electric
                    ears. Both worm and the spiral-bevel
                    have been adopted because of their
                    quiet operation as compared with the
                    straight bevel and quietness In Inclosed
                    electric cars is an asset The use of
                    worm drive also has resulted In Umtna
                    ttne near reductions between motor and
                    rear axle. The use of spiral bevel gears
                    probablv has been caused by the use of
                    ,hl ivtin In ennolene nasseneer cars'.
                    Second In Importance to the method of
                    drive comes springing and for the first
                    time electric vehicle maKers nave con
                    nfdered the cantilever seriously, a sum
                    mary showing that four makers are us
                    ing this type. These are the Baker and
                    Buffalo, which use cantilevers in tho
                    rear only, and the newcomers. Mllburn
                    and Columblnn. which use cantilevers
                    both front and rear. Semlelllptlc front
                    nnd three-quarter elliptic rear Is the
                    usual construction, although practically
                    vcry type, such as elliptic and plat
                    form rear, are 'to be seen. One rather
                    unusual method of springing has been
                    Incorporated in the Woods cars. In this
                    the springs rest not upon the axles, but
                    upon radius rods and Instead of fasten
                    ing the springs outside the frame they
                    nr attached lnulde the channel.
                    Electric motor devejament for these
                    vehicles has tended toward greater ca
                    pacity to care for overloading ivd the
                    use of square-section wire on the arma
                    ture and ribbon for the fields is in
                    greater use than ever before. This con
                    struction allows of mort copper being
                    used and hence a more powerful motor,
                    without Increasing tho overall dimen
                    sions. These changes have helped to
                    make the electric more efficient in hlU
                    climbing.

                    of the Electric Vehicle Association" of
                    America. It was organized March 12,
                    1914, in the offices of the Fotomac Elec
                    tric Power Company, and since then
                    has grown materially in membership
                    and in effectiveness.
                    The Washington Bectlon is a branch
                    of the parent organization which has
                    Its headquarters in New York, with sec
                    tions in various cities throughout the
                    country. The object of the association
                    is to advance the interest of users of
                    electric vehicles as well as those who
                    sell the machines and the various things
                    that go With electric automobiles.
                    The officers are E. S. Marlow, chair
                    man; R. Bruce Emerson, vice chair
                    man; c. M. Marsn, secretary-treasurer.

                    chairman committee on traffic.
                    The Washington section meets month
                    ly and these meetings are marked by
                    the reading of interesting 'papers pre

                    Social sessions are held from time to
                    time and the members are brought into
                    close personal touch through these soci

                    Remove Tires and Clean
                    And Graphite the Rims
                    In winter and in rainy seasons it Is
                    a good plan to remove the tires and
                    clean and graphite the rims or use a
                    preparation containing this material.
                    Mix oil and powdered graphite together,
                    making a very thick paste. Next clean
                    the rims, smoothing up any rough places
                    that may exist, and apply the graphite
                    freely. Rub off with a cloth, which will
                    Impart a bright finish, leaving a sur
                    face that will resist the action of water
                    or moisture, and which will make chang
                    ing tires an easy matter.
                    An ounce of powdered graphite used
                    between the shoe and tube will prevent
                    the tube from sticking and eliminate
                    frlctional blowouts. .

                    bile concerns Is the Cook to Stoddard
                    Company, which handles the Baker elec
                    tric and Cadillac gasolene car. For 1915
                    the company Is showing the full Baker
                    line, which consists of four chassis with
                    the leader, a four-passenger coupe,
                    wlilph htm ilthor whfwl or Ip.ver starr
                    ing. The main feature of this coupe, it
                    is stated, 1b that It Is of lighter con
                    Htructlon as compared with many elec
                    trics of the coupe form. This lightness
                    of weight Is said to have been brought
                    about by a simpler chasslB construction,
                    though strength has not been sacrificed.
                    Cantilever rear springs and seml-elllp-tlc
                    fronts support the presscd-steel
                    fiamo, which has a klck-up at the rear

                    Thoro are two sets of Internal expand
                    ing brakes on the rear wheels, operated
                    independently by two pedals. An auto

                    Tho new Baker has a graceful exte
                    rior due to the lowering of the body and
                    the long wheelbasc. The curves are full
                    and sweeping. Body panels are of
                    aluminum and sashless windows are
                    used throughout. The door windows
                    are operated by mechanical means with
                    lcer control.
                    Featuring the Detroit electric the firm
                    of Emerson & Ormo Is meeting with
                    much success In the sale of cars. The
                    firm was organized some years ago, and
                    is numbered among tho most successful
                    In the electric field.
                    The .1915 Detroit electric offering Is
                    six-body types, four of which are
                    broughams and one a cabriolet mount
                    ed on a chassis of 100 Inches wheel
                    base, and the sixth, a small brougham,
                    is fitted to a chassis with M-lnch
                    wheclbase. All of the models on the
                    longer wheelbase have worm drive with
                    the worm underneath tho wheel, and
                    their batteries are slightly larger than
                    that of the shorter model which Is fitted
                    with a helical bevel gear rear axle.
                    Battery capacity has been enlarged by
                    increasing the plates from thirteen to
                    fifteen. The number tf cells has not
                    been altered. The 100-Inch wheelbase
                    cars have forty-two cells and the 94
                    inch car forty cells.
                    A feature of importance Is the metal
                    compartment ahead of the motor and
                    accessible to a trap door In the floor,
                    In which Is mounted the controller
                    mechanism brake, Klaxet horn, ammeter
                    shunt and throw-over switch. The horn
                    replaces a bell signal, and the throw-
                    over switch Is used to change the light
                    Ing connections from one half of the bat
                    tery to the other. For additional protec
                    tion the controller has an extra cover
                    of its own which can be removed by
                    loosening two clips. To remove the con
                    troller from the car it is only necessary
                    to disconnect the cables and loosen three
                    screws.
                    Steering continues to be by a hori
                    zontal lever mounted parallel with the
                    control lever, the latter being operated
                    by the left hand. Three separate sets
                    of brakes are provided, operating inde
                    pendently. The two sots of foot brakes,
                    on the rear hubs, are of the internal ex
                    panding type, 16xU4 inches. Between tho
                    two foot brake pedals Is a third pedal.
                    Pressure on this applies both rear hub
                    brakes, locks them and automatically
                    cuts off the power. The hand brake
                    operates on the motor and Is applied by

                    Little progress has been made as yet
                    there with electric motors and the en- I
                    gineers are still ha filed by the problems
                    of storage of sufficient power and not
                    too much weight. With the petroleum
                    and the steam motors, they are much j
                    more successful. The energy and the j
                    skill that first went into the making of
                    the pleasure carriages that whirled up
                    and down the Champs Elysees and the
                    Bois de Boulogne to the alarm of pedes
                    trians, and before which even bicyclists
                    gave ground, have turned now to self
                    propelled drays and trams, and those
                    have been the chief subjects
                    periments.
                    For example, a tramcar with seats

                    A CLOSED CAB,
                    fourteen passengers, has made a series
                    of journeys successfully, if none too
                    economically; while several sorts of
                    drays with petroleum motors have
                    proved In the actual routine of business
                    their ability to carry heavy loads at as
                    high a speed as the conditions of traffic
                    and municipal regulations permit and at
                    less cost than that of horses.
                    Their chief drawback has been the
                    frequency and the slowness of repairs;
                    but with allowance for loss from these
                    breaks in regular service, several mer
                    chants that have tried them on a con
                    siderable scale side by side with ordi
                    nary vans agree that they are the more
                    economical by 10 per cent.
                    The introduction of the automobile in
                    to the United States was first made no
                    ticeable by a number of the Newport
                    fashionable colony who made their ap
                    pearance on Ocean avenue last summer
                    in the most approved French fashion of
                    horseless carriages. This was quickly
                    followed by the forming of horseless
                    carriage companies in several of the
                    larger cities, and now the horseless car
                    riage is almost as familiar a sight as is
                    the hansom or ordinary one horse cab.
                    In New York there has recently been
                    established a public electric cab service
                    which has proved to be not only prac
                    tical but economical for its patrons and
                    a paying Investment for the backers of
                    the enterprise. Indeed so successful has
                    this system been that the famous old
                    ramshackle stages on Fifth avenue in
                    that city are to be superseded by auto
                    mobiles.</text>

                <text>The beginning of the end was in sight
                    when electricity first supplanted the
                    horse as a means of propulsion for
                    street cars. Then the bicycle came,
                    sprang at once into popular favor and
                    rendered still more limited the uses of
                    our once essential quadruped.
                    But now still greater changes are
                    taking place. The introduction of the
                    automobile on streets of American cit
                    ies is slowly but surely driving out the
                    old fashioned hansom and the two horse
                    brougham, and now even the lorrie team
                    and the long overworked draft horse
                    are to become ‘things that were.”
                    The recent formation of a company in
                    New York city with a capital of some
                    $100,000,000 to exploit compressed air as
                    a motive power for all trucking and
                    carting business in Greater New York
                    shows still again how surely the reign
                    of the horse is passing away. He will
                    of course continue, for a time at least,
                    to remain the pet and the trained speed
                    ing animal of the wealthy in the city
                    and the helpful friend of the more hum
                    ble farmer in the country. But as timne
                    goes on and urban population becomes
                    more and more dense it will be seen to
                    be even more necessary in order to ob
                    viate congestion of traffic in city streets
                    and to maintain a proper degree of san
                    itation and cleanliness to allow only
                    self propelling vehicles on the public
                    streets of our towns and cities.
                    The outcome of this will be a vast
                    improvement in the condition and
                    smoothness of all city streets, the abo
                    lition of the objectionable cobblestone
                    as paving material and the elimination
                    of the ear piercing noises which now
                    make a pandemonium of the average
                    metropolitan thoroughfare.
                    It is true, motor vehicles for pleasure,
                    traffic and business purposes have been
                    somewhat slow of adoption in this coun
                    try. The horse has held his own here
                    with remarkable pertinacity, for it has
                    been in European cities, and particular
                    ly in Paris, that the automobile indus
                    try has flourished to the greatest ex
                    tent. The principal reason why Ameri
                    cans have been in no undue haste to
                    adopt motor carriages is the fact that
                    mechanically these have not hitherto
                    been sufficiently developed to render
                    them acceptable for general use. The
                    motive power employed in most of them
                    has been unsatisfactory because of lack
                    of efliciency in some cases and extrava
                    gant expense: of operation in others.
                    But American brains and American en

                    PpfcIaJ to th Indianapolis Journal.
                    NEW YORK, June 3. Within the course
                    of six months to one year the streets of
                    Indianapolis will be filled with the odd-looking,
                    rapidly-moving. Ingeniously-constructed
                    vehicles, which completely fulfill Old
                    Mother Sblpton's otherwise discounted
                    prophecy that "carriages without horses
                    shall go." In other words the automobile,
                    with all Its comfort, slrapllcitj cheapness
                    and speed, will soon bo as familiar a sight
                    to the residents of Indianpolis as they now
                    are to the citizens of New York, London
                    and Paris.
                    For the purpose of Introducing these end-of-the-century
                    equipages in Indianapolis
                    and certain other of the larger cities, three
                    companies have been incorporated at Tren
                    ton. N. J., with many million dollars of
                    capital. They are the New York Gas and
                    Electric Ught, Heat and Tower Company,
                    the American Electric Vehicle Company and
                    the Electric Storage Battery Company. The
                    first of -these concerns has a capital of $2,
                    000,000, which may be Increased soon to $100,
                    000,000; the second a capital of $5,000,000, and
                    the last $16,000,000, having- been Increased
                    cly a shor time ago from $12,500,000. Be
                    hind all three of the companies, which are
                    so closely allied es to be practically under
                    the control of the same men, is the vast
                    wealth of Whitney, Wldener, Elkins and
                    other well-known traction capitalists who
                    now control many of the big street-railway
                    systems of the East and have bought up
                    and own the patents and privileges of va
                    rious styles of automobiles and the improve
                    ments thereon.
                    It is the purpose of this syndicate to form
                    a subcompany in Indianapolis and other
                    cities In which they are to Introduce their
                    cheap horseless vehicle service, allowing the
                    local capitalists now interested in the dif
                    ferent means of intramural locomotion em
                    ployed there an opportunity to become in
                    terested in the autocab and freight wagon
                    service. The direct management of the af
                    fairs of the Indianapolis subcompany will
                    be to a large extent in the hands of In
                    dianapolis capitalists, bfit on lines laid down
                    by the parent company, which will retain a
                    controlling interest in each of the com
                    panies.
                    The organization of the Indianapolis com
                    pany Is now under way and as soon there
                    after as the necessary number of autove
                    hlcles of the various styles most popular
                    and necessary can be manufactured, the
                    service will be actively introduced. These
                    styles will Include the popular hansom of
                    which so many are seen in New York the
                    coupe, the Victoria and the landau, besides
                    various patterns of eprqss and delivery
                    wagons.
                    FARES WILL BE CIIEAr.
                    The point, however, which is most impor
                    tant to the patron of public equipages, as
                    well as to those who would be patrons, but
                    are now prohibited by reason of the cost,, is
                    that the automobile service contemplates a
                    cheapening of cab and carriage fare in In
                    dlanapolis and every other city where the
                    service is established.
                    The intention is to reduce fares Just
                    enough to attract patronage from both the
                    street cars and horse cabs. It is argued
                    that a cheap cab service will get not only
                    an enormous percentage of the patronage
                    now going to livery stables and other own
                    ers of public conveyances, but that there
                    are great numbers of people, who would
                    regularly patronize cabs instead of street
                    cars if the fare were made low enough to
                    come within their means.
                    In London, Paris and other continental
                    cities the cab fire is much lower than in
                    American cities, and it is said that it is the
                    intention of the auto people to fix rates in
                    Indianapolis approximately at about the
                    same as those of European cities.
                    That the promoters of the plan to intro
                    duce the automobiles can well afford to give
                    their patrons, a cheaper cab service than
                    they now enjoy is manifest by reason of
                    the excessively cheap cost of maintaining
                    electric cabs as compared with malntalnln
                    the horses and cabs of a horse-cab service.
                    Fewer men will have to be employed by the
                    automobile companies, as stablemen, etc.,
                    will not be required. Also, the barn area
                    needed will not be so large, as the automo
                    bile "stable" does not have to provide stalls
                    for horses.</text>

                <text>OCTOBER 28.-Wo are to have a
                    large party here on Hallowe'en, the
                    :'.lsr. Miss Langham likes keeping
                    up old customs, and we are to have
                    all the weird rites of the charmed
                    evening carried out.
                    Site has presented Margery and me
                    with new dresses for the occasion
                    very pretty ones they are.
                    My beautiful sister has evideutly
                    won tho hearts of both our kinsmen.
                    Anthony Langham loves her, I can
                    see, though he is kept from her by
                    the constant watchfulness of Mr.
                    O'Halloran; so, to console himself,
                    he takes refuge with me and admires
                    her to me, and listens.to my sisterly
                    praises with pleased smiles.
                    Happy Margery! If she marries
                    him, she will be truly fortunate. I
                    told her so this evening, as we were
                    dressing for dinner, but she only
                    laughed and said:
                    ..What, should we live on, Sophy?
                    He has only his wits for dower."
                    A nobler inheritance, in my mind,
                    than Maldon itself.
                    Ah! how the wind howls and moans
                    through the trees. The night is full
                    of noises. Surely I hoard a bolt
                    opeued down stairs. If it, should be
                    robbers!
                    I have listened, for some time, with
                    a beating heart, but there has been
                    no repetition of the grating sound;
                    it must have been my fancy or the
                    v. ind.
                    I will close my book, say my
                    prayers and go to bed; it is silly to
                    write so late, with my lire just out
                    and my room gloomy from the feeble
                    light of my candles. It makes me
                    nervous and fanciful; so good night,</text>

                <text>ALL HALLOW EVE.
                    The Sast of Octdber, the eve of All Saints I
                    Day, has been for ages a timeof festivities,
                    peculiar costumes and ceremonies, in the
                    old countries, but of these there are few
                    traces in our country. It is a season when
                    fairies and wood-land elves come out in
                    force, play pranks on passers by, dance
                    merrily on the bill sides, and perform fa
                    vors for those who have the good fortune
                    to meet with them and fall into their good
                    graces The weather had been very wet
                    and disagreeable for some days, but on
                    - Saturday it cleared up cool and pleasant.
                    SIn "the good old days" the young folks
                    gathered in the evening to enjoy the plays
                    and stories of the time. One legend di
                    Srects the young girls who wish to know
                    who their future husbands will be, to go
                    to a grocery store and there steal a her
                    B ring; taking it out of the brine it must be
                    - roasted without washing or cleaning, and
                    e eaten up. They must then go backwards
                    s to bed and drink no water. During the
                    Snight the future partner of their joys will
                    Sappear and offer them water from a clear
                    running brook. Many a bonnie lass bas
                    taken her supper of salted herring and
                    gone to rest, to dream that she was laying
                    Sin the shade of some favorite tree. with a
                    Smurmuring brook close by, the cool waters
                    of which were temptingly near her parched
                    lips. yet be3yond the most frantic efforts to
                    .reach it in her dreams. On this night
                    they pull the Yarrow and sleep on it, the
                    charm of which will bring them a vi.son
                    of their sweet-heart. Going to the fields
                    they pull nine blades of the plant, repeat
                    ing at each:
                    "All hail to the Yarrow, the wisest of
                    flowers,
                    SThon flairest of floweTrs to me,
                    I tryete thee to tell io,, before morn
                    Who my true lovec shall be."
                    SThey then retire to rest and must speak
                    no more until 'Ster they have slept. The
                    following legend I believe has never been
                    in print, ~althoughl it is quite current in
                    C the north of Ireland, where it is believed
                    by many to be true:

                    the expected visitors and then retired to
                    bed. During the night they were awak
                    ened by a most terrible storm, with vivial
                    flashes of lightning, during one of which
                    the shadow of a coffin moved through the
                    room and stopped by the plate of the
                    younger girl and immediately after a
                    young man in sailor's clothes entered the
                    room and going to the plate of the other ['
                    cut some bread and cheese, and then dis

                    sailors who was saved fell in love with the of
                    other girl and they were married. Their ii

                    the wife was laying in bed, her husband

                    Written for The Morn*in*g Call .
                    All boys and girls know that October 31st
                    is "All Hallow Even," though most of them
                    corrupt its name to "Holly Eve." They
                    know that it is a night of mirth and mys
                    tery specially devoted to mischief, fun, in
                    cantations,' divination charms and spells,
                    but very few of them or their elders under
                    stand its real significance or can tall whence
                    it derives its name.
                    It is many centuries since the Roman
                    Church, finding it impossible, from the
                    great aud constantly increasing multitude of
                    the saints, to set apart a separate day for
                    each one, decreed that November Ist should
                    thenceforward be kept as a day in honor of
                    all the saint!), and that It should bo known
                    as All Hallow Mas, or All Saints' day, and
                    that the night of October 31st, immediately
                    preceding it, should thereafter be kept as a
                    vigil aud known as All Hallow eve, th°se
                    occasions beine still observed In the Cath
                    olic, Episcopal and Lutheran churches.
                    From its first origination Hallow eve has
                    been invested with a peculiarly mystic
                    character. It is an almost universal super
                    stition that supernatural influences then
                    have unusual power— that devils, witches

                    free to roam through space, and that the
                    spiritual element in .ill livinglhum&nity can
                    be detached from corporeal restraint and
                    made to road its own future or to reveal to
                    others what fate may have In store for them.

                    justify these singular ideas and customs as
                    sociated with Hallow eve, nnd an none of
                    them are of a religious character, we may
                    justly regard them as relics of pagan times.
                    In all ages and countries Hallow eve has
                    been dceiued. as it still Is, the occasion par
                    excellence for devilling the answer to that
                    momentous question which absorbs so laree
                    a share of the thoughts of romantic young
                    men and maidens, "who is to marry whom?"
                    The means employed to gain this much de
                    sired information are as quaint and curious
                    as they are numerous and varied. For this
                    purpose
                    EVEBY TIME AND EVERY COUNTRY—
                    Almost every district of every country— has
                    had its own charms and spells peculiar to it
                    self, and they lava furnished up almost in
                    exhaustible theme to folk- poets and com
                    pilers of folk-lore. Those of Scotland have
                    been most graphically described by that
                    greatest of all poets of the people, Itobert
                    Burns. In his poem of "Halloween" ha
                    has given us a most vivid account of more
                    than half a score of Hallow eve charms
                    and spells peculiar to the Scottish peasantry.
                    In a very old book of folk-ore called "Vo
                    True Arte To Keade Ye Future" 1 find the
                    following: "If a maid would know ye
                    name of ye man she is to marry, let her on
                    All Hallow even steal out to a lime-kiln and
                    throw therein a clue of blue yarn, still hold
                    ing to ye other end. Piesentlv ye end In ye
                    kiln will be sharuly pulled. Then ye maid
                    must say 'who holds?' Whereupon ye voice
                    of her future husband will pronounce his
                    name — both ye Christian and ye surname."'
                    The only obstacle to the successful per
                    formance of this spell is the difficulty of
                    finding an old lime-kiln, but as lime-kilns
                    will be In great demand among our young
                    women when the important statement m ide
                    in the above paragraph becomes generally
                    known, aud us a demand for any article in
                    this country is speedily met by an abundant
                    supply, the number of lime-kilns will doubt
                    less sunn be largely augment-, d, to the great
                    delight of anxious match-making mammas
                    and their dutiful offspring.
                    Water, nuts and apples bear a prominent
                    port in the spells and charms of Hallow
                    eve. A quaint old book of charms, pub
                    lished in Edinburgh in 1070, entitled: "Old
                    Father Time's Bundle of Faggots Newly
                    Bound Up," declares that an infallible
                    means of getting a view of your future hus
                    band or wife is to go to bed on Hallow eve
                    with a glass of water, in which a small
                    sliver of wood has been placed, standing on
                    a table by your bedside. li: the night
                    YOU WILL DItEAM OF FALLING
                    From a bridge Into a river and of being
                    rescued by your future wife or husband,
                    whom you will see us distinctly as though
                    viewed with waking eyes. This charm is
                    thus alluded to by the English poet Gay:
                    Last Hallow eve 1 loured my love to see,
                    Ami [rid a spell to call tier up to me.
                    With w<m I ami water nunill'iß by my side
I dreamed a dream and saw my own sweet bride.
IniCOIIDectiOO with tills spell I am remind
ed of a curious circumstance which came
under my immediate observation. While
visiting my younger brother in Newton,
Mass., some year aij", my sister-in-law com
plained at the breakfast table on the morn
ing after Hallow eve that she had spent a
most wretched night. On my inquiring tho
cause she stated that she had hud a strange
ly vivid and most singular dream, from
which she had awakened with a feeling of
the most distressing exhaustion. She
dreamt that she was walking along the
bank of a river, when a gentleman whose
face she saw as plainly and distinctly as
she had ever seen anything and whose
features were indelibly imprinted upon her
memory, fell from a bridge erected across
the stream. Without a moment's hesita
                    tion she plunged into the wat«r and after a
                    desperate struggle succeeded iv bringing
                    him ashore, whereupon she awoke feeling
                    as much exhausted as if she bad actually
                    passed through such a thrilling experience.
                    In less than three mouths from that time
                    my brother sickened and died. His young
                    widow continued to reside in the same place
                    with her two children. Four years later I
                    again paid, her a visit, and while a guest at
                    her house I learned that a bachelor Iriend
                    of mine would be in the neighboring city
                    of Boston on a certain date, and 1 tele
                    graphed him to visit me at Newton. I met
                    him at the railway station and drove him to
                    my sister-in-law's residence.
                    It was a beautiful summer evening, and
                    looking from the carriage as we approached
                    the house we Jaw her watering some
                    flowers on the lawn. At sight of her my
                    friend seemed so much agitated that 1
                    anxiously Inquired the reason of his dis
                    composure and asked if he had ever seen
                    the lady before. He hud barely time to
                    answer, "Yes, once, aud I will tell you all
                    about it when 1 have an opportunity," be
                    fore we had alighted and were in her pres
                    ence. To my amazement she seemed quite
                    as much discomposed as my Irietid had been.
                    He subsequently told me that on the very
                    Hallow eve when my sister-in-law had
                    dreamed the dream above mentioned he had
                    tried the spell of the glass of water and the
                    sliver of wood recommended by my "Old
                    Father Time's Bundle of Faagots," which 1
                    had loaned him, and that ho had dreamed
                    of falling off a bridge into a river, and of
                    being rescued by the lady in whose house
                    we then were, and whom he paw In his
                    vision as distinctly as when he beheld her
                    that night on the lawn. 1 also learned from
                    my sister-in-law that my friend was the
                    very man she had dreamed of rescuing on
                    that same Hallow eve.

                    A VEKY OLD HALLOW KVK DIVINATION,
                    Formerly much practiced by English rustics
                    to tell from what quarter of the compass
                    the future husband or wife will come, i*
                    performed by stealing out unobserved at
                    midnight, plucking a small luck of hair
                    from one's head and casting it to tlm breeze.
                    Whatever direction it is blown toward is be
                    lieved to be the location of the future
                    matrimonial partner. This divination, is
                    also mentioned by Gay in his "Pastorals,"
                    as follows:
                    I pluck this lock of hair from out my bead
                    To ten whence comes the one that 1 shall v.cl:

                    Until you reach the spot where my true love Is
                    found.
                    There can be no question that many of
                    the observances of Hallow eve are derived
                    from those of the old Koninn festival cf
                    Pomona, when divinations and the consult
                    ing of oracles mid omens were universally
                    practiced. Lighting bonfires is one of the
                    oldest aud most universal of Hallow eve
                    usages, yet the Germanic and Celtic na
                    tions were both accustomed to kindle them
                    on October 31st, centuries before they ever
                    heard of the Christian religion, ana its vigil
                    of All Hallow eve. It Is probable that the
                    boys of those old races indulged, on that
                    date, in the same mischievous practices
                    which now afford so much pleasure to our
                    own youngsters, and no doubt the little
                    sons and daughters of the ancient Romans,
                    Germans and Celts carminated the munici

                    led") quite as extensively as our own chil
                    dren do now by ringing door-bells and run

                    A Scotch writer who contributed an
                    article to an American newspaper about
                    Halloween last year declared himself
                    "very much impressed by the almost
                    universal observance of Halloween and
                    its old customs in America." Ho added
                    that the forms most taken by tho observance
                    of tho nigh there were, and equally
                    to his interest, rather Scotch-Irish
                    than English. Farther on ho says that
                    "Halloween has always been and still
                    trrmcG at lugging or gates.
                    is the feast of the year, when gentle
                    and simple meet and enjoy themselves
                    together, irrespective of social barrier
                    and caste, so rigorously observed on
                    other occasions. "
                    This view of Halloween will perhaps
                    be entirely new to a majority of those
                    who read this writing. Halloween is
                    observed in the United States, to be
                    sure, and perhaps in some parts of the
                    country with some of the same superstition
                    that marks its observance among
                    tbo&e who dwell on the British isles,
                    but this is rarely the fact among those
                    of the ' 'old time American stock. " This
                    is especially true of those descended
                    from the Puritans. Thoso sturdy old
                    iconoclasts cast out all sorts of belief
                    regarding saints' days and pagan festi
                    vals, including even Christmas and the
                    Eastertide, in their prohibition of celebrations
                    that savored of either the Roman
                    church or the Druids. Tho observance
                    of Halloween is a mixture of
                    both, and I have no doubt that there
                    are many thousands in the United
                    States, some of whom will read these
                    words, who were in as dense ignorance
                    of Halloween in their childhood as
                    was a business man of one of our
                    largest cities with whom I converted

                    when I was a boy, " said this man. ""'1
                    never heard of Easter either until I
                    was 17. of 18. Full knowledge of both
                    did not come to me till I 'went away to
                    school' with money I had earned work
                    ing in the hayneld and the apple orchard,
                    and then I read their history in
                    the 'Book of Days.' But I knew all
                    about Paas (I used to spell it Pees) and
                    cabbage night. I used to hide eggs in
                    the haymow for days, waiting for the
                    first, and the standing cabbages and the
                    winging gates of the neighbors used to
                    suffer on the second, I tell you.
                    Cabbage night! That's the title the
                    American boy applies to Halloween.
                    And a right lusty, sturdy savage the
                    American boy is like to be on that night
                    It must be confessed that the joys of
                    cabbage night, its breathless exertions
                    and runnings here and there in the darkness,
                    its pulling of bells and knocking
                    at doors, its lifting and lugging of gates,
                    its stretching of ropes across paths to
                    trip the unwary, all seem rather flat
                    and silly to the man whose hair is getting
                    gray and who is beginning to be
                    fat or rheumatic or perhaps both. But
                    they weren't flat and silly some 20 or
                    SO years ago, were they, old fellow? Do
                    you rememberwhat fun you had stealthily
                    tying two cabbages to Deacon Ellis'
                    front door knob on cabbage night
                    in 186? or 1868? How you then knocked
                    at the door and dodged behind the
                    big cherry tree in the yard where Tom
                    Waters was hidden before you? How
                    you then saw the young theological student,
                    who was "settin up" with the
                    deacon's pretty niece, when he opened
                    A LITTLE SERMOX.
                    the door? How he was so angry when
                    he saw the joke that he began to say
                    something that sounded very much like
                    a "big, big DV How you snickered so
                    loud that he heard you, and darting out
                    into the darkness caught you both and
                    dragged you into the parlor, where he
                    stood you, nearly helpless with mortification,
                    before his sweetheart, preached
                    you a little sermon, smiling the while,
                    which sounded very funny to the young
                    lady, but very serious to you? And how
                    at the windup he confessed that he had
                    himself done such things when he was
                    boy, but thought them rude and suggested
                    that in future you spend
                    een going about restoring unhinged
                    gates to their own and t'ie commission
                    of other similar good ikeds?
                    If that reminiscence be not one of
                    yours, then one somewhat similar probably
                    is unless yon were a city boy, as I
                    was not. I suppose there is no docbt
                    that town born lads havo quite as much
                    fun in their weak way and manner as
                    counrry lads, bet I must confess I have
                    never been able to understand how.
                    It is not patting it inaccurately, I
                    imagine, to say that Halloween, observed
                    according to the methods that
                    are time honored across the ocean, is a
                    new institution, comparatively speaking
                    at least, in America. It was brought
                    here by settlers who came latter than
                    tho Puritans, by immigrants who came
                    to better their condition and not for
                    liberty of conscience. In some sectiocs
                    where the population is largely made
                    up of this latter element the old English,
                    Scotch and Irish legends undoubtedly
                    obtain, yet it is extremely doubtful
                    if there is one-tenth of tho Halloween
                    superstition anywhere in the
                    United States that exists in the mother
                    country unless it is among tho negroes
                    of tho south, where, since the extreme
                    observances of the occasion resemble
                    those of the "voodoo doctors" so closely,
                    it has been completely assimilated
                    into the system of superstitions held by
                    the children of Africa.
                    A sort of half belief in Halloween
                    superstition has been widely disseminated
                    by the boarding schools of the
                    land, and it is safo to asmno that there
                    is far more of Halloween observance
                    among the children and young folks of
                    the rich and well to do than among
                    those whose parents work for wages
                    throughout the land. It is quito customary
                    nowadays for parents to plan
                    Halloween parties for their children, at
                    which many of the sports of tho season
                    are entered into.
                    Bobbing for apples, throwing apple
                    peelings over one's shoulder to see what
                    initials the peelings will form, pouring
                    melted lead into water for a similar
                    purpose and the like are favorito diversions
                    at these little parties. As diversions
                    they are harmless, but in all seriousness
                    the inculcation of superstitious at Halloween,
                    or any other time, for that matter,
                    should be avoided, for the human
                    creature is desperately inclined to be
                    superstitious, no matter how modern,
                    and there is nothing more torturing
                    in life than to bo a victim of some belief
                    in the significance of omens and
                    signs and presentiments, even if the victim
                    knows in his inmost heart that
                    there is nothing at all to justify such
                    belief.
                    As a study the folklore of Halloween
                    is most interesting. The origin of
                    the observance is unmistakably Druid-

                    two nAZL snrrs i threw bto the flame
                    ical, and, although the date was shifted
                    to that of All Souls' night when Christianity
                    usurped heathenism among the
                    Teutons, the Anglo-Saxons and the Celts,
                    there is nothing about its legends and
                    ceremonies that does not savor of the
                    pagan. Pulling the kail (or cabbage) to
                    find if one's spouse to be will be stout
                    or lean is one, and from this no
                    doubt came the hilarious phantasies of
                    the American cabbage night. Hazel nuts
                    and chestnuts play an important part in
                    English Halloween observances. The
                    poet Gray tells of this most delightfully
                    in these lines:
                    Two hazl csu I threw Into the flame.
                    And tOTOch nut 1 cvb a sweetheart's name.

                    For 'twas thine own that did so brightly glow.
                    In the old days it was believed that
                    witches did travel abundantly on Halloween.
                    The fairies, too, did then disport
                    themselves most friskily, and spells
                    then worked that worked no other night.
                    The burning bf bonfires was general in
                    Wales and Scotland on Halloween, and
                    lads and maybe lasses, too, then went
                    out masked and dressed in garments of
                    quaint design.
                    -There were also many games on Halloween
                    in other times of which nothing
                    is preserved, save in tradition.
                    Some of these games were such a3 would
                    not be admissible now, for the refine
                    ment of those old days was much less
                    than that of today, no matter how they
                    may have excelled the present in other
                    directions. Those games which had for
                    their object the discovery of a future
                    husband's or wife's identity were naturally
                    most popular. Here is a recipe
                    for securing an answer to the question
                    (apposed to bo most important to every
                    girL It is from an ancient publication,
                    entitled "The Tree Fortune Teller:"
                    "To know whether a woman will
                    have the man she wishes get two
                    lemon peels. Wear them all day, one in
                    each pocket. At night rub the four posts
                    of the bedstead with them. If she is to
                    succeed, the person will appear in her
                    sleep and present her with a couple of
                    lemons. If not, there is no hope."
                    Here is one from the latitude of Chicago
                    It i adapted to city observance,
                    but it is not warranted: Fill
                    your mouth with salt and run around
                    the block, when your true love will of
                    a surety show himself.
                    Eva Lnvett has put this one into
                    rhyme. It is an old favorite with all
                    Halloween devotees:
                    At midnight lone hempseed is thrown
                    (The peeping elrei can see).

                <text>THE very mention of Halloween calls
                    up visions of ghosts and witches
                    and all kinds of uncanny things. It
                    ls the one night ln the year when
                    J^ even the uninitiated, if they are
                    brave enough, may converse with
                    spooks and hobgoblins, and may also, if
                    they try hard enough, send the immate
                    rial part of their being prancing through
                    space on all kinds of errands. It Is safe
                    to surmise that the latter privilege is not
                    often taken advantage fot. It is hard
                    enough to keep soul and body together
                    without hunting up excuses to separate
                    them. But the grand object of all the
                    mystic rites peculiar to Halloween is to
                    find out who one's future spouse will be
                    —that Ing a very Important question
                    with those who have never had one.
                    The most infallible of the many Infalli
                    ble ways by which a girl may get a
                    glimpse of her future husband is to re
                    tire in silence. That alone is hard
                    enough, but that is not all. She must lie
                    there, speechless and in the dark, until
                    Just before the stroke of 12, when she
                    must rise and, standing before the mir
                    ror, it an apple while combing her hair.
                    If she doesn't see her "future" peeping
                    over her shoulder it's because she is des
                    tined to be an old maid, or she was too
                    scared to look.
                    Another way that does not .-equire so
                    much courage is to write the alphabet
                    on twenty-six little slips of paper, one
                    letter on each .-lip, and then urn them
                    face down in a basin of water. This done,
                    go to bed backward and in silence. Si
                    lence seems to be the main requirement
                    in ail these endeavors to coax one's af
                    finity to make himself, or herself, known.
                    Next morning some of the letters in the
                    basin will be found face up and the name
                    thus revealed will give the desired infor
                    mation.
                    A more comfortable custom is to wet
                    tho sleeve of a shirt and hang it before
                    the fire to dry. Then lie in bed and watch
                    lt until midnight, when the apparition of
                    the future husband or wife will' appear
                    and turn the sleeve.
                    If a girl has two lovers and cannot de
                    cide which one to choose, she may let
                    fate settle the matter in the following
                    manner. Eat an apple and then, naming
                    two Of the seeds, stick one on each cheeK
                    and bay:
                    Pippin, pippin, I stick thee there.
                    j stick thee there.
                    That which is true thou mayst declare.
                    The one that stays tho longest is the
                    must faithful lover, and therefore the
                    most desirable. «-

                    Robert Hums are now- obsolete, but one
                    stii: in vogue is that of pulling kail or
                    cabbage stalk. A young couple are blind
                    folded and then, taking each other by the
                    hand, they go into the garden and each
                    pulls a stalk at random and they return
                    to th.c fireside, where their prizes cause a
                    great deal of merriment. As the stalk is
                    long or short, straight or crooked, so
                    shall the future husband or wife be. The
                    quantity of earth sticking to the root in
                    dicates the amount of wealth and the
                    taste of the pith the kind of temper "tie
                    must expect. Finally the stalks are
                    placed over the door, and the christian
                    names of the next two entering will be
                    the names of the future husband and
                    wife.
                    A custom that is quite common in this
                    count! aiso Is to ike three saucers and
                    fill c:.. with clean and another with dirty
                    water.' The third remains empty. The
                    part;. wishing to know his destiny is
                    blindfolded and led to tie hearth, where
                    the saucers have been arranged. If he
                    dips his finger in the clean water he will
                    marry a maid, but If in the? dirty water a
                    widow will knd him to the altar. The
                    empty dish signifies that a life of single
                    CARPET TACKS SAVED THE SHIP.
                    BUT CAPTAIN JOSHUA SLOCUM HAD A CLOSE CALL.
                    Captain Joshua^Slocum. in his solitary
                    voyage around tne world in the sloop
                    Spray, found a new and exciting use for
                    carpet tacks. He thus describes an en
                    counter with the Natives of Tierra del

                    up and called to me, V Yammerschooner I

                    Apples and nuts play a very important
                    part in the mystic rites of Halloween. One
                    way to find out If one's sweetheart is
                    true Is to place three nuts upon .lie bar
                    of the grate or on the hearth, naming the
                    nuts for the loved one. If a nut cracks
                    or jumps, look for another sweetheart
                    right away, for the one you have will
                    surely be unfaithful. If a nut burns that
                    Is a sign that your affection ls reciprocated.
                    but if two of the ruts burn together the
                    young lady making the trial may as well
                    begin preparing her trousseau at once,
                    for there will surely be an early wed-
                    ding.
                    Halloween parties must always be made
                    as weird and uncanny as possible, and
                    * any one with original id< ie may give
                                                them full scope on these occasions. One
                                                very quaint affair that 1 recall may
                    ' serve as a model.
                    In the first place the Invitations were
                    most unique* Witches and goblins ran riot
                    over the card and the utmost secrecy in
                    regard to the approaching event was ex-
                    acted. Silence, too, was enjoined,, and
                    every one was veiled, and it certainly was
                    a very ghostly crowd that gathered
                    promptly at the appointed time in the
                    dimly lighted hallway. Suddenly the
                    sound of a bell -was heard, soft and- muf-
                    fled, as If it were high up In an old church
                    tower, and as it struck 9 the doors were
                    thrown open and the young people were
                    ushered into a veritable witches' den.
                    Death heads, made from pumpkins, with
                    a small lighted candle inside, grinned
                    from the mantel, the cornices and the
                    most unexpected places. Huge cobwebs,
                    In which were monster spiders, were
                    stretched across the corners and over the
                    mirrors. Immense bats with outspread
                    wings were apparently flying through the
                    air and great owls glared from every pos
                    sible resting place. In the fireplace, the
                    grate had been removed and in its stead
                    a large caldron was simmering over a pale
                    green blaze.
                    The hostess and her assistants were
                    witches, gowned in flowing black robes
                    and crownev with tall, pointed caps. In-
                    visible music of a weird character added
                    to the uncanniness of the scene. The
                    gentlemen were all in an adjacent room
                    and tbe hostess, taking a lady by the
                    hand, would advance with tier and knock
                    three times on the door with the small
                    broom she carried. In answer to her
                    knock a gentleman would appear, and
                    Offering the lady his arm retire to a dis
                    tant part of the room. When, in this
                    manner, the couples had all been paired
                    off the wltchefe wave,] their arms and
                    crooned in the most approved witch
                    manner and the screeching of the violins
                    outside became truly blood-curdling. Sud
                    denly, with a crash and a bang, the noise
                    ceased and the room was filled with light '
                    When the light revealed the partners that
                    at Buenos Ayres, and which I had still
                    on board. I arranged forward on the look-
                    out, dressed as a seaman, attaching a line
                    by which I could pull It into motion.
                    That made three of us. and we did not
                    want to "yammerschooner;" but for all
                    that the savages came on faster than be-
                    fore. . I saw that besides four at the pad-

                    were others in the bottom, and that they
                    were shifting hands often. : At eighty
                    yards I fired a shot across the bow of the
                    nearest' canoe, at which they all stopped,
                    but only for a moment. Seeing that they
                    persisted ln coming nearer, I fired the
                    second shot so close to the chap who
                    wanted to "}*ammerschooner" that he
                    changed hie mind quickly enough and bel-
                    lowed with fear. "Bueno yo via Isla,"
                    and sitting down in his canoe, he rubbed
                    his starboard cat-bead for some time. I
                    HERE ARE SOME ANCIENT CUSTOMS
                    . THAT YOU WILL FIND MOST INTER-
                    ESTING TO EXPERIMENT WITH
                    fate had given each for the evening there
                    as a good deal of merriment. At a sig-
                    nal from the First Witch a couple went
                    Into the outer darkness to pull "kail"
                    stalks. Of course they had been prepared
                    beforehand and there was not a straight
                    one in the whole lot. After this ordeal
                    had been gone through by every one a
                    decrepit old hag. with a real, live owl
                    perched on her shoulder, entered the
                    room. On her arm hung a basket full
                    of nuts. Passing through the crowd she
                    gave each a nut and then.' standing by
                    the fireplace, she mumbled some unin-
                    telllgible Jargon and the room suddenly
                    became darkened again. Stooping over
                    the caldron she muttered an Incantation
                    and red fire Immediately blazed from Its
                    depths. She then tottered out of the
                    room, which again was illuminated as she
                    disappeared. The nuts, when cracked,
                    were found to contain a fortune, written,
                    on a slip of paper. For example, "You
                    will have many trials until the age of 30,
                    when good luck will come to you." The
                    nuts for the gentlemen were tied with
                    red ribbons and those for the ladies with
                    blue. .V - 
                    During the evening all sorts of games,
                    peculiar to Halloween, were added to the
                    programme. A stick was suspended hori-
                    zontally from the celling and on one end
                    was a short piece of lighted candle, while
                    an apple was stuck *on the other, and
                    the whole thing set whirling. A small
                    basket was then passed around in which
                    were a number of slips of paper. The
                    unfortunate who drew the paper with a
                    skull and cross-bones on It had to furnish
                    was thinking of a good port captain's ad

                    a bite from the apple on the whirling
                    stick. Luckily for the girls, a man drew
                    the fatal slip, but before he had burned
                    his mustache off the First Witch took

                <text>nO holiday on the calendar deyeu^.
                    more for Its charm upon tradtlon and
                    the customs handed down from genera
                    tion to generation- than does that fateful
                    night of mirth and mystery — Hallowe'en.
                    Most of oar American holidays com
                    memorate historic events within the past
                    entnxy and ¦ half and consequently can
                    not of course, have any of the charac
                    teristics of ancient ceremonial. Even
                    Christmas has, in Its observance, been
                    modernised ont of all semblance of the
                    old-tfme celebration. Hallowe'en, how
                    •r, not only retains Its time-honored
                    significance and long-established ritual
                    trot finds Its chief attraction In these re
                    minders of bygone periods.
                    The festival of the night of October 81
                    has a number of different designations,
                    though none are so commonly nsed as
                    Hallowe'en. The others are All Hallow
                    ¦yen, Nutcrack Night and Snapapple
                    Night, the latter two being derived of
                    course from practices associated with
                    the occasion. Hallowe'en derives Its
                    most common name as the eve or vigil
                    of All Saints' or All Hallows Day (No
                    vember 1). From time out of mind this
                    has been heralded as a night when
                    witches, devils and other mlschlef-mak-
                    Ing beings go abroad on their baneful
                    midnight errands. By a strange coinci
                    dence, however, this same night Is sap
                    posed to be devoted by the fairies to a
                    grand anniversary celebration.
                    The traditions of Hallowe'en also teach
                    that on no 4ther night In the twelve
                    month do sach supernatural Influences
                    prevail as after dark on the final day of
                    October. According to ancient beliefs the
                    spirits of the dead then wander about and
                    In some Instances the spirits of living per
                    sons have conferred upon them the tem
                    porary power to Join the ghostly clan.
                    Persons who have nad the good fortune
                    to be born on October 31 are especially
                    likely to be warned or advised by the
                    elves on each recurring anniversary of
                    A LITERARY PILGRIMAGE
                    3CST as thousands of tourists visit Ob
                    erammergau to witness the Passion Play
                    and hasten to Bayreuth for Wagnerlan
                    festivals «o enrh year nearly the same
                    number visit Weimar, the Athens of mod
                    ern Europe. Ever since the two great
                    est German poets made this place sacred
                    with their memories, scholars and writers
                    no less than musicians have found it a
                    worthy retreat. Dickens and Thacksrey
                    spent some time here and George Eilot
                    and Madame de Stael Bought Weimar as
                    a place of Inspiration. Amalla Winter
                    in her charming Weimar album describes
                    the many brilliant English and Rus
                    sians who came to take tea with Goethe's
                    daughter-in-law, and spent the evening
                    listening to the reading of German and
                    English poetry. An Englishman of that
                    day wrote In his diary these words In
                    memory of Goethe and the days he made
                    golden: "Sad heart why do you awaken
                    In me memories of those golden days
                    that flew bye so quickly. In the classic
                    town on the llm noted for its culture,
                    life In the open air and pleasure. Weimar,
                    oh, yonr name and Its associations haunt
                    me now." There are still plenty of ncso
                    elation to delight the thousands of trav
                    elers who spend several happy days
                    ¦midst these literary haunts.
                    Weimar ts an attractive place In Itself,
                    Hallowe'en
                    A HOLIDAY OF
                    TRADITIONS
                    their natal day, but sometimes, so It Is
                    said, other persons have the gift of con
                    versing with the airy visitants on such
                    occasions.
                    Saint Matrimony is the patron saint
                    of Hallowe'en and Indeed this autumn
                    holiday Is best known as the night of all
                    nights for peering Into the future and
                    especially for discovering just what sort
                    of husband or wife fate has selected for
                    each unmarried participant In the rites.
                    It Is this function of the holiday which
                    helps to keep Its observance alive with
                    the young people of the nation and not a
                    few of their elders who are yet youthful
                    In spirit. Not only are the mysterious
                    spirits that are abroad on Hallowe'en
                    supposed to be Infallible In their verdicts
                    but it Is also of manifest advantage that
                    they demand neither fee nor reward for
                    piercing the veil that hides the future.
                    The performance of some very simple
                    ceremony Is all that Is exacted of the
                    curious young man or woman who would
                    learn Interesting particulars regarding the
                    destined life-partner.
                    The origin of Hallowe'en seems to be
                    hidden In 'an Intermingling of classic
                    mythology and Christian superstitions.
                    The plan of making nnts and apples con
                    spicuous in the Hallowe'en festivities Is
                    traced back to the custom of the ancient
                    Romans to hold on November 1 a feast
                    to Pomona, the goddess of fruits and
                    seeds, at which time there was a formal
                    opening of the stores of eatables laid
                    up In summer for use during the winter.
                    On this same date occurred the great
                    autumn festival to the sun with which the
                    Druids or ancient Celts celebrated thanks
                    giving for their harvest and It was the
                    belief of the Druids that 'on the eve of
                    their holiday — the present Hallowe'en —
                    it rests In a valley surrounded by moun
                    tains and splendid woods of the Tliur
                    ingen forests. The air Is refreshed by n
                    small river which wanders geutly and
                    romantically about the meadows, ami
                    woods and again rus'aes on so forcibly
                    It must be held back by a dam. The
                    town Is adorned with a beautiful park
                    and some splendid monuments and some
                    very attractive homes. The Hotel Erb
                    prinas Is one of the show places because
                    of Its historic associations. This hotel
                    was formerly a large inn and was for
                    ninny months at a time tha home cf Ger
                    many's greatest poets, musicians and
                    painters. When Franz Llsst first came
                    to Weimar this was his only home for
                    five months. Here he practised and
                    played for many of bis friends and wrote
                    many of the compositions whlqji were
                    later brought out at the Opera house.
                    His bedroom and the room occupied by
                    Goethe are the two most popular rooms
                    In the House and guests bid high to say
                    they lived In tha Lint and Goethe rooms.
                    There Is nothing especially noteworthy
                    In Its furnishing except the beautiful
                    writing desk at which the great musi
                    cian and composer wrote. The top Is
                    shaped like a Greek; temple decorated
                    with mirrors and marquetry wood. The
                    rest of tha furniture Is limited to a

                    Few women or girls can be said to '
                    look really pretty in one of these veils,
                    but there are many degreee of attractive-

                    the really important point. Some are I

                    An English motoring veil which is i
                    satisfactory is made in the following
                    way:- Buy two yards of chiffon or chiffon

                    one ,-nd in a point twenty inches from
                    the other end. Hem it across the two
                    pieces of the loner end and all around
                    the cut edges; the outer edges will, of

                    The witches told wonderful fortunes
                    for everybody, and a large witch, who
                    occupied a central post, stirred a cauldron
                    from which she continually distributed
                    favors. *■ -
                    The gnomes «nd brownies roasted the
                    chestnuts on the large hearth, and the I
                    fairies danced around their favorite
                    teacher and presented her with three
                    magical gifts— Italian coral to keep

                    rose colored glasses, through which she
                    might always see the bright side of life.
                    These fairies were not the ordinary
                    tarletan and spangled creatures that we
                    have grown accustomed to hear desig
                    nated by that name, but were, as far as
                    possible, faithful reproductions of the
                    little people of famous fictiou, the creat

                    Scotch Highlands and the German forests
                    as they have been depicted by poets,
                    painters and prose writers. It took some
                    trouble to evolve the costumes, but not
                    as much expense as might be thought on
                    first consideration, for many of the cos
                    tumes were made entirely of crepe paper,
                    and in all of them this material entered j
                    largely.
                    Black paper was most effective for the!

                    difficult time —one of the smaller girls was j
                    chosen for this —because the other
                    guests at the frolic insisted on her going
                    on all fours a large part of the time,
                    which, in spite of her gymnastic training,
                    was not altogether agreeable.

                    The Origin of Halloween
                    The only mysterious festival left to
                    prosaic Americans Is Halloween. Its
                    origin is plainly Pagan, although the ro
                    mantic element has come to us from
                    England, Ireland and Scotland
                    Around the 1st of November the Druids
                    were supposed to hold their worship of
                    the sun god, thanking him for the har
                    vest. Huge sacrificial fires were TTghted
                    In his honor, and kept lighted for days
                    This Influence can still be seen in the
                    "bonfire night" In Ireland.
                    The Roman conquerors penetrated as
                    far as Britain, and from them comes the
                    custom of using nuts and apples on Hal
                    loween. On this night Soman, the lord
                    of death, was believed to call together
                    all the souls of the wicked. These were
                    condemned to Inhabit the bodies of
                    beasts for a year, and Halloween marks
                    their release.
                    This fact or belief perhaps, marks
                    the predominance of the mysterious ele
                    ment In Halloween frolics. It Is the

                    spirits walk abroad They sour the

                    usually attributed to small boys
                    Robert Burns In his poem, "Halloween,"
                    gives us a good description of the ways
                    employed to penetrate the veil of the
                    future. Three nuts are placed on the
                    hearth. Each Is named after a. lover.
                    If one cracks, he will be unfaithful.
                    If one burns, ha will be faithful, etc.
                    llany maidens ate an npple slowly before
                    a. looking-glass. The face of her future
                    husband was supposed to peep over her
                    boulder.
                    Children bom on Halloween are sup
                    posed to have the power to perceive and
                    communicate -with spirits. Sir Walter
                    Beott makes use of this in his romance,
                    "The Monastery."

                    A lighted candle
                    should be placed in
                    the middle of the
                    .room, and each guest
                    should be blindfolded

                    The Needle-threading Test
                    It is very hard to thread a needle when
                    seated on a round bottle laid lengthwise
                    on the floor. It will roll about In the
                    most surprising fashion The one who
                    succeeds in threading the needle first will
                    be the first to get married.

                    Hallowe'en in Frolics
                    Pretty games belong to Halloween more
                    particularly than nny other time of the
                    year. Certainly, no other feast offers
                    such a variety of them Every country
                    lends it epecullar customs, for Halloween
                    is countless centuries old.
                    "Ships of Fate" Is perhaps the prettiest
                    and most romantic game of all Little
                    ships are made of half an English walnut
                    shell, -with little toothpick masts secured
                    to the bottom of the shell with candle
                    grease. The name of each guest Is
                    printed or written on each boat. A little
                    lighted candle Is placed In the stern
                    Place these In a tub of water and fan
                    gently. Much amusement follows the
                    gradual pairing off of the boats Tho
                    candle, of course, typifies good health
                    Whoever has the candle which burns tho
                    longest may expect a long and happy
                    life. The boats may bo Improved upon
                    In countless -ways and look very attractive
                    with the lights shining In the water.
                    A new version of the old custom of
                    bobbing for apples Is, perhaps, not so
                    exciting, but decidedly more reassuring
                    for the unfortunate victims who have to
                    go home on a cold night with wet cloth
                    ing. The apples are placed in a row,
                    using green, yellow and red ones al
                    ternately. The guests are supplies with
                    darts, or tiny bows and arrows. Shoot
                    ing a red apple signifies success In love,
                    a yellow one, money, and the green one
                    health.
                    An old English custom Is that of hang
                    ing a stick parallel to the celling by a
                    strong cord. On one end of this Is stuck
                    a large lighted candle, on the other an
                    apple. The stick Is then spun around
                    rapidly, and the guests are supposed to
                    secure a bite of the apple The pleasure
                    of this game Is very doubtful.

                    Buch things before the open Are are less
                    strenuous and still popular amusements
                    for Halloween.
                    The Boasting of Chestnuts
                    The true lovers' test Is found In the
                    roasting of chestnuts. A young man and
                    a girl should each place a chestnut on
                    the bars of the grate and carefully watch
                    their behavior. If they stay quietly side
                    by Bide, then the young couple who
                    placed them there will lead an easy,
                    peaceful life together But If, as Is fre
                    quently the case, the nuts hiss and steam,
                    then such behavior Indicates quarreling
                    between tho owners. Frequently one
                    chestnut will act In a wild manner, Jump
                    Irg away from the other and hlBslng
                    loudly, and this Indicates that the owner
                    has a bad temperl

                    Into a piece of string about a yard long
                    a raisin Is strung. Two people then take
                    each an end in their mouths and hastily
                    chew as much as possible. The one who
                    reaches the raisin first will be wedded
                    first.

                    player fits at the side between the lamp
                    and the sheet The other players
                    must then pass In turn behind the one
                    sitting on the stool, their shadows being
                    thrown upon the sheet They make all
                    sorts of contortions and grimaces, wear
                    false noses and beards, etc, and the
                    man on the stool must try to guess their
                    identity This Is a rather difficult proposl.

                    An Old English Halloween Custom

                    Halloween quite alone, and will pluck a
                    hair out of the head and cast It away,
                    watching carefully In which direction the
                    breeze may blow it The future partner
                    will live in the direction In which the
                    hair blows To make the charm work,
                    the following verse should be recited
                    aloud:
                    "I pluck this leek of hair off my head
                    Tu tell wboBie com the one I shall wed.

                    tho clear water, then the future partner
                    for llfo will be young, charming and
                    handsome
                    A ory amusing game Is played with
                    mashed potatoes. Into tho midst of the
                    mashed potatoes a dime, a ring and a
                    thimble should ba placed. The potatoes
                    are then eaten by the guests, nnd great

                    ception of a legacy or the gaining of
                    riches
                    A eplcndld way of entertaining the
                    guests Is the hiding of nuts or apples in
                    different places In the room. Several
                    people should then be blindfolded, and
                    they must hunt around for the hidden
                    articles Hostesses who valuo their fur
                    nlturo and ornaments, etc , wil start this
                    bolbtorous game at their own risk.
                    An amusing game Is tho trial by water.
                    The gueet must fill his mouth with water
                    and walk nround tho house without swnl
                    lowlng or losing a drop of It. The first
                    person met of the opposite sex will bo
                    his fate. The Idea Is to send two young
                    people out by different doors. If the
                    young people selected are at all friendly,
                    the fun will wax fast and furious, and as
                    they are sure to meet, this simple game
                    may bring matters to a crisis.
                    Apple-Paring Test
                    A third and most popular Halloween
                    game Is played with applesklns. The
                    npple should be pared, care being taken to
                    do so In one long, unbroken piece. The
                    paring should then be swung around the
                    head, flung over the left shoulder and
                    allowed to drop on the floor The letter
                    thus farmed will show the Initial of Uie
                    thrower's future mate for life.
                    The Fun of Forfeits
                    No Halloween party Is complete without
                    the forfeit toll. When a player Is fined
                    for the breach of some rule or for some
                    mistake In a game, or for being defeated
                    In some test, he must at once surrender
                    a piece of his private property, such as
                    a stud, or. In the case of a girl, a bracelet
                    ur biooch or something of the sort
                    A ready-witted person is then chosen to
                    play the part of the Justice. There Is
                    also a collector, who holds out the arti
                    cle forfeited, crying, "Who Is the owner
                    of this pretty thing?" The owner then
                    comes forward, kneels down at the feet
                    of Justice and Is told what he must do
                    to redeem the goods. The penalties are
                    varied and amusing:
                    "Leave the room with two legs and
                    come back with six " The way to do this
                    13 to go out Of the room and return carry
                    ing a chair
                    "Place one hand where the other cannot
                    pet at it." The way to do this is to grasp
                    the elbow.
                    The quick-witted Justice will Invent
                    many amusing penalties, and the game of
                    forfeits will proceed in a very lively
                    manner.
                    Fortune Telling on Halloween
                    One of the party
                    should dress up as a
                    witch or gipsy and
                    tell the fortunes of
                    the rest of the com
                    pany Another method Is
                    to write the for

                    Feast days and fast days, holidays and
                    festivals come and go, but Halloween
                    Is unique. It Is vested with the charm
                    of all that there Is of the mystical, the
                    strango and the weird and the super
                    natural. Evil spirits hold high carnival, witches
                    ride the air, goblins and hobgoblins,
                    fairies and elves appear boldly, and the
                    souls of the dead come forth from their
                    graves and roam the earth.
                    Even Us origin Is mysterious, pagan
                    and Christian with a .dash of the
                    mythological thrown In, perhaps. Long
                    ago a feast was held in honor of Pomona,
                    goddess of tho harvest. In England the
                    Druids held a harvest celebration nt this
                    time of year and built great bonfires
                    In high places in honor of the sun
                    that ripened their grain. In the Cath
                    olic calendar the Eve of All Saints
                    coincided with the pagan festival and
                    became Involved In the fantastic rites
                    of the earlier celebration.
                    It Is a night when It Is not safr to
                    be out in the dark and alone, a night
                    when any man or maiden has the right
                    and the might to invoke the spirit of
                    tho future spouse by strange spells and
                    Incantations. Faith In maslo Is all that
                    Is needed.
                    And It Is a night, flrs.t and last and
                    all tho time, when grown-up pooplo can
                    cast aside the affairs of state, the pomp
                    of circumstance, and be what thoy would
                    most like to be la all the world merry
                    hearted children.
                    And If we no longer really and truly
                    believe In the supernatural, there Is a
                    remembrance of the belief to serve the
                    purpose and a wish that la almost a
                    faith In Its power
                    In a word, Halloween Is romance, the
                    Never-Never Land that we are all seek
                    ing, Bometlmes unknowingly and some
                    times with the dusty highway of tho
                    commonplace stretching ahead of us In
                    terminably, and blinding our eyes.

                    In these days of apartment living one
                    may have to beg, borrow or steal a cel

                    thero Is no place quite ltke It for a chil
                    dren's Hallowe'en party. The descent to

                    A cellar, with grinning Jack o'Lan
                    terns, giving an orange glow for tho only
                    light; with autumn leaves and grasses
                    festooned from the walls nnd celling; with
                    witches, bats, cats nnd owls cut from
                    black paper In nllhouotto and pasted
                    against white walls, makes a picture In

                    forces awake and abroad on this one
                    night of tho year.
                    A witch's caldron mndo of pasteboard,
                    covered with black paper and set on a
                    tripod, should bubble over with Hallow
                    con favors. A bona fide witch, dressed
                    with all the mummery of the part, should
                    preside and distribute crackers, rattles
                    and whistles to all bold enough to claim
                    them.

                    and a placo for a tub already filled with
                    water should be found somewhere In tho

                    shown being chiefly orange, dcop reds

                    a border of wltchos and cats In black.

                    and garments of shreddod orange and

                    of card players In general.

                    Such a partner is a grievous trial, but
                    aay, with Cervantes, "Patience and shuttle
                    the cards." To act annoyed at a partner's
                    Ignorance of the game Is out of place; to
                    criticize her play is Inexcusable.
                    As for the giggly person, who cheer
                    ftillj disregards alt her partner's signal
                    bids, looks bored while her opponents
                    play the dummy hand; in brief, who
                    doesn't try at all, nothing Is too terrible
                    She should either give cards up entirely
                    or pay attention. That Is only fair to the

                    Scientific "brldgers" have been blamed
                    for their strict attention to the game This
                    Is a very good fault, Those who play o

                    pair of fancy ghnes or a camisole, can

                    On the whole. It Is the card player who
                    always had a good time, whether he wins
                    or loses; who takes defeat like success,
                    with a bmlle, who plays carefully and
                    wins occasionally: who is willing to help

                    Yes, surely you know about lt-the
                    Halloween Jinx. It's only a theory, soma
                    people say, but nevertheless awful things
                    have been known to happen when you
                    mado tho Jinx mad.
                    You see, Halloween Is Buch a mysterious,
                    eerie old night that tho elves and goblins
                    and hobgoblins and whatnots all creep
                    from their holes and peer around Well,
                    If they should happen to see any kiddle
                    or grown up, either with a frown on'
                    A piercing shriek may be heard through
                    out the house, and by this the unhappy
                    "frowner" knows his fate. The "Jinx"
                    Is on you for another j'car.
                    So bo careful, kiddles, to smile and
                    frolic, so that the Halowcen Jinx won't
                    see you when he comes prowling around
                    tonight.</text>

                    Hallowe'en when it started far
                    back in the mists of time, was the
                    night when evil spirits were supposed
                    to flock out of hiding and roam tho
                    earth, marauding and destroying.
                    After many centuries we see the
                    work of the evil spirits Inherited and

                    It illustrates how next to impossible

                    out of the human brain, once It gets

                    It was custom for him to arri'O
                    late in the ernlng and make merry
                    at uch pastiues as elder drinking
                    and apple bobbin? When the fun
                    I was over and ihe landlord got. down
                    to business, it was early morning of
                    November 1 .

                <text>Hallowe'en.
                    All Saint's Day is a festival of the
                    churches—othsnrlae called All Hallow
                    Day. The evening of the 3lst of Oc
                    tober Is called* All Hallow even, or
                    Hallow E'en ss being the vigil or ev«
                    of All Hallow day. H&llowtide is a
                    comprehtaslvs name for tfttfe days
                    The-Roman dathollo church designed
                    this day to be held in honor of all
                    those saint* who had not particular
                    days appointed for them.
                    It does not appear, says an' old
                    writer, that All Saint's
                    day
                    or Its eve,
                    was ever marked by very particular
                    service in the Catholic church. Never
                    theless there is scarcely any time
                    more distinguished by the common
                    people throughout the British islands,
                    or even In our own land, the United
                    States, than Hallowe'en.
                    Rather more Is It suspected that the
                    inspiration for its celebration In the
                    manner now adopted, Instead of
                    being taken from church rltss, was
                    adopted from the customs of
                    our
                    Ringing of bells was one of the
                    modes of celebrating Hallowmas In
                    England in the early days.
                    In celebration of the day, nuts were
                    cracked and eaten. Apples were also
                    extensively eaten and hence in the
                    north of England, All Hallowe'en Is
                    often called Nut-crack Night. There
                    were other fortune telling customs be
                    sides those described by Robert Burns
                    which you have no doubt all read as
                    they are so quaintly described in his
                    poem on the subject. The more dur
                    ing rites of the celebration have In
                    later years been omitted by polite
                    people as to course for practice.
                    At meetings of young persons on
                    the day, a plentiful supply of nuts and
                    apples were provided and a few
                    simple amusements practiced. The
                    experiment of the burning nuts, to
                    test the durdeon of lov« or friendship
                    was a favorite pastime. Docking for
                    apples was another. A tub being pro
                    vided, nearly full of water, and the
                    fruit thrown in, the young people en
                    deavored to seize a floating apple In
                    their teeth—a task much more din
                    cult than might be supposed, and
                    which generally puts the dresses and
                    tresses'of the fair girls entering the
                    contest into considerable disorder.
                    The baffled efforts of the various par
                    ties, raise shouts of laughter.
                    Or a cross stick is suspended by a
                    string from the celling, with a short
                    burning candle on one end *nd an
                    apple on the other. While it swings
                    rapidly round, lads and lasses, with
                    their hands tied, attempt to catch the
                    apple with their teeth, but generally
                    suffer a good deal from the burning
                    candle before they succeed in their
                    object. Here also failure brought
                    about much merriment. It has been
                    thought rather remarkable that Burns
                    did not Introduce Into his poem any
                    notice of these sports, which like the
                    others, were prevslent In his day over
                    the whole of his majesty's domains.
                    From these came the custom of
                    celebrating the day, but It is observed
                    In a much different manner in our
                    own country. Any number of Hal
                    lowe'en events are planned or are
                    being planned in Keokuk. Some have
                    Anticipated the day and have already
                    celebrated It.

                    land on tlfe first of November np to
                    half a century, ago, and the custom
                    may still be kept up In some remote
                    places of those 'ands.
                    It is stated by Pennant that "in the
                    north of Wales there Is a custom upon
                    All Saints' eve of making a great 111*
                    called Coel Coeth. Every family, about
                    an hour in the night, make a great
                    bonfire In the most conspicuous place
                    near the house, and when It Is almost
                    extinguished, everyone throws a white
                    stone into the ashes, having first
                    marked it, then having said their pray
                    ers turning round the fire, they go to
                    •bed. In the morning a« soon as they
                    are up, they come to search out the
                    stones, and if, any of them are found
                    wanting, they' have a notion that the
                    person who threw it in will die before
                    be sees another Hallow Bve." It is
                    mentioned by another writer that they
                    dance round and jump through the
                    bonfires, and at the conclusion always
                    run away "to escape the black, short
                    tailed sow."
                    It Is also written that both in
                    Perthshire and In Ireland that many
                    years ago that the day was itroperly
                    regarded as the proper time for ven
                    turing thankg for the realised fruits
                    of the earth. The Irish, In this regard
                    called it "La Mas IThhaV that Is. the
                    day of the apple fruit, and celebrated
                    it with a drink or mess composed of
                    bruised roasted apples among ale or
                    milk. This drink in time acquired the
                    strange appellation of lamb's wool, a
                    corruption, apparently, of the name of
                    the day in the Celtic language.</text>

                <text>Tonight at the Country Club.
                    Thursday is All Saints’ Day, and this
                    evening is consequently "All Hallow E’en."
                    Out at the Country Club It will again bo
                    celebrated. All Hallow E’en, or Hallow
                    E’en, as it is usually called, has not been
                    very much observed here of late years, but
                    the large and interested crowd of people
                    who bobbed for apples and chewed up rib
                    bons with marshmallows tied into the mid
                    dle of them and a pretty girl on the other
                    end, and sailed fortune boats, and had their
                    palms read, and out flour and did a.dozen
                    other weird, mystic and ridiculous things
                    last year, are anxious to do it all again this
                    year, and so a committee has been actively
                    engaged in digging out pumpkins to mako
                    poke-o’-moonshine and arranging the vari
                    ous other fateful symbols and decorations
                    to give them that pleasure. Some very
                    novel features have been added for this oc
                    casion; the ballroom is being glassed in;
                    big wood fires, warranted not to smoke, will
                    be blazing in the open fireplaces, and a gen
                    erally good informal fun and easy time
                    may be expected out at the club house. The
                    Hallow E’en games seemed to be entirely
                    new to most of the people last year, who
                    were much too dignified and wore too good
                    clothes to sit down in a chair and be fed
                    with flour in a long-handled spoon, blind
                    folded, for instance; but this year the tun
                    promises to be better worth seeing. Mem
                    bers of the Country Club who are at all
                    nervous about "hants" hiid better by all
                    met ns stay at home, because, as for ghosts
                    and "hants,” the place will just be alive
                    with them. One of them may even lead the
                    german. There will be dancing, of course;
                    refreshments—just maybe so—but a general
                    good time from half-past 8 on to the mystic
                    and fateful hour of midnight.</text>

                <text>It will not be too late, perhaps, the morn
                    ing after Halloween to write briefly of its
                    origin, -for Halloween parties are by no
                    means fln de siecle affairs. A writer says:
                    “It is the vigil of Hallowmas or All
                    Saints’ Day, yet it has no Christian mean
                    ing, but, on the contrary, is essentially
                    paganisUic. The authorities agree in plac
                    ing it under pagan festivals and absolutely
                    separate (it from any Chiflstian anniversary.
                    The most ancleiut of Halloween customs
                    and the most essential part of Ithe Hal
                    loween ritual seem® to consist of Une build
                    ing of a huge bonfire by each household at
                    nightfall. This poUnlts to tlhe very ancient
                    and widely diffused practice o-f -otf kindling

                    and the latter on tlhe eve of tlhe 1st of
                    November. Probably the winter as well as
                    the summer festival was from the beginning
                    regarded as the season at which the fairies
                    were both unusually active and unusually
                    propitious.
                    There is no evidence to show that the
                    methods of divination at present usually
                    resorted to were originally regarded as lim
                    ited in Itiheir efficacy to any one day. But
                    on Halloween espebiadly spirits were sup
                    posed to walk tlhe earth, strange dreams
                    foretold prosperity or adversity, lovers
                    were tested -by various charms, future mar
                    riages were arranged, and the wilder the
                    superstition the more current its belief.
                    According to ancient tradition, -thalt which
                    is human is endowed on Aid Halloween
                    with the wondrous power of detaching Itself
                    from the visible and allowing the spirit in
                    dividuality ito leave its house of flesh and
                    blood and soar away to 'the read ms of 'tlhe
                    Immaterial. Out of this union o*f spirits
                    came the belief in 'the great power of divin
                    ation on that night to obtain whatever was
                    wished or longed for. In modern times
                    Halloween has always been enjoyable be
                    cause of »the popular superstitions attaching
                    to it. There is something attractive, espe

                    ceremonies long antedated Christian
                    ity. The Druids were probably the
                    first to have ceremonies around No
                    vember 1. They held a great autumn
                    festival and lighted fires in honor of
                    the Sun-god, as a thanksgiving for
                    the harvest. They believed that on
                    the eve of this festival Saman, the
                    lord of death, called together the
                    wicked souls that within the last
                    twelve months had been condemned
                    to inhabit the bodies of animals.
                    The cutom of lighting Hallowe'en
                    fires sunived until recently years In

                    As many small stones as there were
                    persons around the fire were placed
                    in the dying embers. When a search
                    was made the following morning, if
                    any of the stones were missing, the
                    persons who had placed them there
                    would die within the year, it was be
                    lieved. Nutcrack Night is England's
                    name for this holiday.

                    The young people throughout the
                    land are anxiously looking forward to
                    Hallowe'en on Friday, October 31. On
                    that evening parties of various sorts
                    will be held, and all the games and
                    pranks attending Hallowe'en will be
                    consummated. Granges will justly
                    have occasion to celebrate Hallowe'en
                    this year, as the harvest has been
                    bounteous, in fact, throughout this
                    broad country of ours never before
                    have the tillers of the soil been re
                    warded for their labors early in the
                    morning until late at night with such
                    bumper crops of wheat and corn and
                    other fine grains, also fruits and ves-
                    Ketables of various varieties.
                    And so many of the granges will
                    hold social and festive gatherings on
                    Hallowe'en. Their halls will be garb
                    ed, with creations of Dame Nature,
                    corn on the ear and the stalks, with
                    other grains and foliage, tinted by tho
                    handiwork of nature in such colors
                    that make it difficult for the artist to
                    reproduce on canvas. Fruits and
                    vegetables of all kinds will be dis
                    played for inspection and decoration,
                    either on the platforms where local
                    plays will be given, or on those old
                    fashioned long tables where at least
                    a dozen neighbors were wont to sit
                    to and partake of the "fruits of their
                    labor," well prepared by the queens
                    of the homes, and put on the table
                    steaming hot to be relished and en
                    joyed by the grangers for miles
                    around, who just love to get together
                    on such occasions and tell about the
                    size of their crops of potatoes and
                    corn and this and that kind of fruit,
                    and to hear the other folks tell what
                    success they have had during the
                    past productive season. Their work
                    is for the greater part done; their
                    cribs and storehouses are bulging out
                    with foodstuffs for the winter months,
                    and their time from now on until the

                    the name given to October 31 as the
                    vigil of Hallowmas or All Saints' day.
                    Though now known as little else but
                    the eve of the Christian festival, Hal
                    lowe'en and its formerly attendant
                    ceremonies long antedate Christian
                    ity. The two chief characteristics of
                    the ancient Hallowe'en were the
                    lighting of bonfires and the belief that
                    of all nights in the year this is the
                    one during which ghosts and witches
                    are most likely to wander abroad.
                    Now on or about November 1, the
                    Druids held their great autumn festi
                    val and lighted fires in honor of the
                    Sun-god in thanksgiving for the har
                    vest Further, it was a Druidic be
                    lief that on the eve of this festival
                    Saman, lord of death, called together
                    the wicked souls that within the past
                    twelve months had been condemned
                    to inhabit the bodies of animals. Thus
                    it was clear that the main celebra
                    tions of Hallowe'en were purely Dru
                    id leal and this is further proved by
                    the fact that in parts of Ireland Oc
                    tober 31 was, and even still is, known

                    which nuts and apples, as represent

                    important part. Thus the roasting ot

                    many stones as there were persons
                    around and next morning a search
                    was made. If any of the pebbles
                    were displaced it was regarded as cer

                    is only incidental to the sport, and
                    the joyous spirit runs so rampant that
                    the use of towels quickly undoes all

                    Ghosts.
                    Ghost stories will be told in num
                    bers. A gathering was overheard re
                    cently planning for the coming Hal
                    lowe'en. One of the party told a
                    ghost story that is worth repeating,
                    even though it might spoil the amuse
                    ment of a Hallowe'en party so far as
                    this particular story is concerned. It
                    is told about a middle-aged colored
                    man in the south. He had done his
                    day's work and was returning to his
                    log cabin rather late on Hallowe'en.
                    Strange noises caused him to quicken
                    his pace into a run, for he had seen
                    sr. gaost following close at his heels. As
                    he ran the ghost also ran and the
                    race was becoming the more interest
                    ing because of the effort exerted by
                    the colored man to outfoot his unde
                    sirable companion, but there was
                    "nothing doing." The "darkle" soon
                    tired and sat on a large stone beside
                    the road to remove the perspiration
                    from his forehead and to get his sec
                    ond wind. He looked to one side
                    and, behold, there was the ghost sit
                    ting beside him.
                    This,, white apparition, suddenly
                    spoke, "we certainly did some run
                    ing, didn't we Jones." Jones, gasp
                    ing for breath, managed to say, "we
                    sho' did, an' we's gwine ter do some
                    mo'h Just as soon as Ah recovers ma
                    breath."
                    It will not be exactly safe to leave
                    easily removable articles loosely
                    about porches and the like on Hal
                    lowe'en. For youngsters are then
                    wont to release some of the superflu
                    ous energy which has been storing up
                    since Hallowe'en first began to be dis
                    cussed at the dinner table. Many
                    will dance and others will celebrate
                    at the theaters of the city. If the un
                    expected happens on Hallowe'en, and
                    it Is likely to happen, parents should
                    be on their guard, as it will all hap
                    pen in a spirit of merriment making
                    only.
                    The Religious Significance.
                    The Festival of All Saints, also
                    known as All Hallows, or Hallowmas,
                    a feast of the Catholic church cele
                    brated on November 1 In honor of
                    aH the saints, known and unknown.
                    In the Roman Catholic church it is a
                    festival of the first rank, with a vigil
                    and octave. Common commemora
                    tions, by several churches, of the
                    deaths of martyrs began to be cele
                    brated in the fourth century. The
                    first trace of a general celebration is
                    in Antioch on the Sunday after Pente
                    cost, and this custom is also referred
                    to in the seventy-fourth homily of St.
                    Chrysostom (407). The origin of the
                    festival of All Saints as celebrated in
                    the west is, however, somewhat
                    doubtful. In 609 or 610 Pope Boni
                    face IV consecrated the Pantheon at
                    Rome to the Blessed Virgin and all
                    the martyrs, and, the feast of the ded-
                    Icatio Sanctae Mariae ad Martyres has
                    been celebrated at Rome ever since
                    on May 13 each year. The idea.
                    based on the medieval llturgiologists,
                    that this festival was the origin of
                    that of All Saints has now been aban
                    doned. The latter is possibly trace
                    able to the foundation by Gregory III
                    (731-741), of an oratory In St. Peter's
                    for the relics "of the holy apostles
                    and of all saints, martyrs and confes
                    sors, of all the just made perfect who
                    are at rest throughout the world." So
                    far. as the western church generally
                    is concerned, though the festival was
                    already widely celebrated in the days
                    of obligation throughout the Frankish
                    empire in 835 by a decree of Louis
                    the Pious, issued "at the instance of
                    Pope Gregory IV., and with the assent
                    of all the bishops," which fixed its
                    celebration on November 1. The fes
                    tival was retained at the Reformation
                    In the calendar of the Church of Eng
                    land, and also In that of many of the
                    Lutheran churches. In the tatter, in

                    of the Holiday.

                    S1 as a Tlgil of Hallowmas or All

                    be here. The small boy, lured by the
                    suggestions shown in the windows of
                    the city, has already coaxed his moth
                    er to buy a mask for the lad. No or
                    ganized plan to observe the day has
                    been started here.
                    The exact cause of the origin of
                    Hallowe'en is somewhat questioned.
                    The Druids held great autumnal feasts
                    and lighted fires around the rst of
                    November in honor of the sun god and
                    the thanksgiving for the harvest. It
                    was also a Druic superstition that up
                    on the eve of this festival Saman, the
                    lord of death, called together the wick
                    ed souls who for the past twelve
                    months inhabited the bodies of ani-nr-H.v

                    piwerSv..,.,, away the wicked
                    spirits. The festival is pure Druidic.
                    In medieval England the roasting of
                    nuts and apple ducking became the
                    sport of Hallowe'en. However, until
                    recent years, in the highlands of Scot
                    land and Wales, fires were built on the
                    occasion and those surrounding the
                    fire would before departing for the
                    night each throw a pebble Into the
                    fire and if the pebble was disturbed in
                    .the warning it was the belief that one
                    of the party was destined to die with-

                    At the present time apple ducking
                    which consists in putting an apple in
                    a tub of water and attempting to take

                    Iteaceful dreams, confident that .your
                    belongings are safe.
                    Tomorrow night Is Hallowe'en,
                    when ghosts, witches, hobgoblins and
                    other asserted ha'nts return to earth
                    and play strange pranks. As the festival
                    falls on Sunday this year, and
                    as many specters are strict observers
                    cf the .Sabbath, it may be confidently
                    expected that the visitation will begin
                    tonight. In any event, it 19 wisest
                    to prepare far the emergency, lest
                    some able bodied ghost or hrsky hob
                    goblin hnppen along and carry on
                    everything that Is left loose.
                    Preparations have been made for a
                    number of ghost and soot parties, and
                    from eight o'clock until midnight the
                    residence section of tie city will be
                    filled with flitting figures. For four
                    hours the young i>eople will give their
                    time anil ingenuity to -pranks and
                    pleasure. Owing to the Impossibility
                    off keeping a separate day for each
                    saint, the Roman Catholic Church
                    centuries-ago set aside November 1st
                    as the day upon iwhlr/i the lives ami
                    deeds of all the saints could be commemo
                    rated.
                    The hallowed eve, which time has
                    abbreviated,, and changed to Hallowe'en.
                    was the .name of the even or
                    -VlgiL of. Ajl SaJptsl-'-From a religious
                    observance tns celebration has come
                    to be an occasion for purely secular
                    entertainment, and according to old
                    legends. It is the one night in all the
                    year when elves and fairies silently
                    and invisibly mingle with the peoples
                    of the earth.
                    Various countries have observed the
                    occasion In vSflbus ways. In England
                    it was long customary to crack- nuts,
                    duck for apples in a tub of water and
                    perform other harmless fireside revelries,
                    on Hallowe'en. Anciently the
                    most essential ceremony seems to
                    have been the lighting of a bondflre
                    at nightfall by every household.
                    In Scotland the ceremonies partook
                    of a more superstitious character, the
                    country folk believing in Its charm to
                    discover who should be his or her
                    partner for life.
                    Ivong before the Christian faith
                    made way among the untutored peoples
                    of ancient Britain, the Druads had
                    performed special rites 011 what Is
                    now known as Hallowe'en, Hallowmas
                    eve. or. as It ig sometimes called "Nut
                    Cracking Night." (Fires were lighted
                    deep in remote forests, upon spurs of
                    hills, even upon the great plains that
                    stretched between dense forests and
                    pnrtially cleared woodlands; my sue
                    rites were performed, the help of the
                    true God, was implored and the machinations
                    of the powers of evil protested
                    against.
                    In America. Hallowe'en is the occasion
                    when the small hoy, and frequently
                    boys who are not very small,
                    are In their'elcment and perform more
                    ingenious, ridiculous and very- often
                    provoking pranks than ail ordinary
                    person would think imaginable. Especially
                    In the country villages and rural
                    districts do their antics cause consternation
                    the. next morning.
                    in these places where the mortal
                    enemies of all fun-loving youngsters,
                    the police, are not around to bother,
                    and all Unit is to be feared Is a town
                    constable, deeds are perpetrated of a
                    more than startling nature. Simple
                    inversions, such as jack-o'-lanterns
                    with hideous faces suddenly shored
                    close against a window pane, grains
                    cf corn tossed with -a terrifying clattocr
                    against ihe door, a few apples,
                    ol' the "mushy" variety, thrown at a
                    dignified pedestrian from some dark
                    corner, open up the evening's amusements.
                    As the night deepens and the hour
                    of midnight approaches, forms are
                    seen sliding silently niway to the town
                    square. Here Is formed a small army
                    of llttio villains. A short consultation
                    Is held. Then' groups of six or eight
                    scatter in various directions. Soon
                    they come creeping back, each and
                    everyone loaded down with a front
                    gate, a buggy wheel, the front porch
                    rocker, wheelbarrows, chicken coops?
                    well, just anything toteabie.
                    With pen tup hilarity the evil deeds
                    go on u|?ce., Suddenly someone has
                    an inspiration! It Is hailed with glee.
                    From somewhere a block and tackle
                    (whatever that Is) is secured and the
                    next morning the village cow Is found
                    contentedly eating hay In the loft
                    .back of tho blacksmith's shop. Ten
                    men are busy half of tho day getting

                    Board of Health of Mexico has issued an order
                    prohibiting the sale of marihuana throughout
                    this country. This deadly drug is sought by the
                    soldiers In the army. It Is smoked like tobacco
                    and the user of it soon goes wildly insane. It 18
                    stated that insanity in the army has greatly in
                    creased of late on account of the use of this plant.

                    drug The Plant grows wild In the mountain, and

                <text>Council Passes Emergency
                    Ordinance to Stop Sale
                    of Mexican Drug.
                    To stop the sale of marihuana, or In
                    dian hemp, is the purpose of an ordi
                    nance passed on first reading by the city
                    council at Ihe meeting Thursday morn
                    ing. The ordinance makes it unlawful for
                    any person, firm or corporation or asso
                    ciation of persons to sdl, barter, ex
                    change or give away or have in his or
                    th.-ir possession any marihuana, or In
                    dian hemp. The dangerous properties
                    of marihuana and the increasing saie,
                    with resulting injury to public health
                    and public morals, are given'as the rea
                    son for inserting the emergency lause
                    making the ordinance effective imme
                    diately following its publication.
                    Mayor Tom Lea, in commenting upon
                    the ordinance, called attention to the
                    increasing use of the drug and the abso
                    lute necessity of adopting a means of
                    stopping its sale, and stated that the
                    city attorney would be expected to co

                <text>NEWANTJ-MARIHUAUA
                    ORDINANCE VERY STRINGENT
                    The anti-marihuana ordinance is de
                    signed to become effective June 14. It
                    is stated by locJ physicans and drug,
                    gists that marihuana has legitimate uses.
                    lit is pnt up by the foremost drujj maitu-
                    mciurers in me ctmuu v miu is ircitrcni
                    ly prescribed, as it Is a sedative of
                    value.
                    While the ordinance is designed , to
                    avoid the sale of this dnip for smoking
                    purposes, no mention is made in the new
                    law that it may be used legitimately.
                    Nearly all of the drug stores in the city
                    have quantities on hand for use in pre
                    scriptions, thouch"they say they never
                    sell it to smokers.
                    The published ordinance will mate It
                    a felony for drug stores to have tub'
                    drug on hand.
                    All are acreed that marihuana, is a
                    dangerous drug and that an effort
                    should be made to have Mexico adopt
                    stringent laws relative to its growth
                    and sale in that country, particularly
                    at border points because he stopping of
                    its sale in 1 Paso will not absolutely do
                    away with the possibility of uses; of

                    i The torriblo effects of the weed
                    were realized by the late President
                    I Parflrlo Diaz and during tho latter
                    years of his administration an order
                    ! was in effect making it an offense
                    punishable by death for any person

                    marihuana cigarettes or the weed
                    tk in any other form.
                    The favorite method of using the
                    t weed is to roll the particles into cig
                    arettes. Mexicans who arc addicted
                    to the habit say that the indulgeuco
                    in one cigarette places them in the
                    ,v "seventh heaven." It brings to
                    i j
                    them a sense or pleasure and"delight
                    that is incomparable and indescrib
                    able If a limit of one cigarette were set
                    no great lasting harm might come
                    to the indulgcr, but in order to keep
                    up the feeling of elation another and
                    perhaps another of the paper
                    wrapped poison is consumed, until
                    the victim Is in a state of wild fren
                    zy. "When in this condition ho often
                    goes on a rampage that brings death
                    to whoever- crosses his path The
                    period of temporary Insanity lasts
                    for seveial hours and is followed bj
                    the victim falling into a deep sleep
                    that lasts 24 hours or more He
                    awakes with no knowledge of what
                    has transpired while the full effects
                    of the drug w ere upon him. It takes
                    only a few months of constant in
                    dulgence in the cigarette haoit to
                    bring on permanent insanity.
                    It is stated that the marihuana
                    weed grows profusely over a largo
                    area of Mexico and that it is found
                    in considerable quantities on tho
                    Texas side of the Rio Grande river
                    In some districts it is a menace to
                    live stock The animals quickly
                    learn to like the weed and when
                    once they have obtained a taste for
                    it they will cat ? nothing else. It
                    In ings death to them in a short time.
                    REALLY A
                    LOCO-WEED.
                    In fact, the marihuana seems to
                    be nothing less than the loco-weed
                    that causes Insanity to both men
                    and beast. If the devastation of the

                    minds through the use of the mari

                    on the Americans and where leaders
                    summon courage to defy the gov

                    Then think of poor Queen Carlotta
                    in her castle in France, with tho
                    doors of her mind closed forever
                    from tho light of understanding, ap
                    parently from an overdoso of tho
                    drug administered in tho form of tea
                    by one of the enemies of her bus
                    band, Maximilian. Tho poor queen
                    in her castle has boon for fifty ycarB
                    and more awaiting death. Last j ear
                    when the Germans invaded France
                    they placed signs on this lone castlo
                    warning that anyone who disturbed
                    the mad queen as she is called
                    would bo subject to severe punish
                    ment. For Queen Carlotta is an Austrian
                    and the Kaiser desired that she be
                    protected, and the German soldiers
                    responded nobly to his wishes, even
                    refusing to fight In vicinity of her
                    castle.
                    HISTORY OF
                    A QUEEX.
                    The story of Queen Carlotta'a in
                    sanity Is ono of tho saddest In all of
                    history and ncr fatc B cven wrso
                    than that of her husband, who was
                    shot to death at the direction of tho
                    French. As retribution for this
                    deed they havo given tho queen tho
                    castle in tho northern part of thoir
                    domain and have maintained her for
                    fifty years qr more at their expense.
                    Here are tlie events that led to
                    Maximilian's regency in Mexico, his
                    tragic end and the Insanity of his
                    queen:
                    In 1S61 the Liberals and Conserv
                    atives in Mexico, while in the midst
                    of one of those revolutions such as
                    we have at the present day, seized
                    on tho property of foreigners In
                    consequence, Great Britain, Franco
                    and Spain concluded a Triple Alli
                    ance at London with a view to forc
                    ing Mexico to pay Indemnities. In
                    December, 1SG1, a force of the Triple
                    Alliance landed at Vera Cruz and
                    occupied It without resistance, tho
                    Mexican troops having evueuated.
                    After a successful conquest of many
                    states it became apparent thnt tho

                    Mexico and perhaps establish a mon

                    troops thcieupon were withdrawn
                    and tho remainder of tho conquest
                    was left to tho French troops
                    On June 10. 1S63, tho French
                    troops under General Forey entered
                    tho City of Mexico after it had been

                    instrumentality of the Emperor Na
                    poleon. The year 1864 was an eventful ono
                    in tho history of Mexico. Tho
                    Trench captured tho city of Mata-
                    moras and tho whoio Mexican army
                    was forced to surrender and becomo
                    prisoners of war.

                    of its internal affairs, was unoblo
                    to act before, but when peaco was
                    restored tho Monroo Doctrine was
                    cited and the French were invited to

                    In May, 1876, tho Juarlsts cap

                    his generals were shot to death on
                    June 19.
                    But before the death of Maximil

                    THEN the lawmakers of CongroM
                    and the various state le;:
                    tures framed the statutes di -signed
                    to end the traffic In habit-forming

                    them comprehensive enough to include
                    every narcotic known to man.
                    But now it has been discovered that,
                    as far as the national laws and those
                    " of all except two or three of the states
                    are concerned, they overlooked one of
                    the wickedest of drugs one that is in
                    many ways more insidious in its luf?
                    and more ruinous in its effects than
                    cocaine, heroin, opium, morphine or
                    any of the others.
                    The wicked drug the lawmakers for
                    prot is marihuana, the Mexican variety of
                    Cannabis indica, or Indian he'mpi i
                    monly known as hasheesh. In the Orient
                    hasheesh has been used for thousands
                    of years. There it is rolled into pills
                    and swallowed, or mixed with sugr
                    and eaten like candy.
                    The Mexicans, however, have n differ

                    plant, crumple them up like tobacco
                    roll them into cigarettes.
                    It is in the form of fffgar that

                    In Americathere marihuana cigarettes
                    are called either "Hying cigarett r
                    "Mary Warner smokes." The "
                    Warner," it will be seen, is American
                    slanc, and is derived from the word
                    marihuana, which has a similar sou 1
                    Tlvyare called "flying" because of the
                    floating sensation the'r fumes produce.
                    The effects of the drug are it irtli f,
                    and while they may differ in individu
                    the general characteristics are nearly
                    always the same. After three or four
                    puffs the beginner's mind becomes con
                    fused. There is, at first, a harmless sort

                    away. He finds himself floating through
                    space as if on a cloud and doing ev
                    thing, in fancy, that he ever wanted to
                    do.
                    Ideas follow each other rapidly.
                    Time, however, is unbelievably pro
                    longed. Minutes seem like days; hours
                    like weeks and days like years. An ex
                    cellent idea of this prolongation of time
                    is seen by comparing an ordinary motion
                    picture film with that of the so-called
                    slow motion camera.
                    Then comes a period in which hallu

                    "We had heard so much of Mexican
                    meals from our friends," says one of
                    of these girls, "that one Sunday eve

                    near Tenth Street, and E-ample some of
                    their national dishes. It seemed to us
                    like any other restaurant, orderly and
                    regular in every respect-
                    "We enjoyed the meal. The dishes
                    were a novelty to us. As the waiter
                    brought the coffee my friend found that

                    "After a
                    few mo
                    ments my friend
                    took one of the ciga- x
                    rettes and also handed one
                    to me. They looked just the
                    same a;j any of the popular brands
                    made in this country. We lighted
                    them.
                    "The first puff burned my throat
                    slightly, but the feeling of exhilaration
                    that followed far outweighed the
                    'burny' sensation. I had smoked about
                    half of it when my companion's antics
                    attracted my attention. She seemed to
                    be bubbling over with merriment. Then
                    during, sav

                    : i managed to get her
                    home, and it was there, in our
                    room, that I reamed she had brought
                    a half dozen of the Mexican's cigarettes
                    with her. Wo smoked them, too. That

                    Marihuana is probably the only drug
                    which is not included in the Federal
                    narcotic bill, known as the Jones-Miller
                    measure. The Harrison act, which
                    has been in operation a number of
                    years, docs not include It either. New

                    York, Massachusetts, California and the
                    city of Dallas, Texas, are the only
                    1 daces where there arc specific laws
                    and ordinances prohibiting the traffic
                    in it.
                    The credit for discovering the extent
                    to which marihuana is being used in
                    this country and taking the first steps
                    to stamp out the traffic in it is due to
                    Dr. Carlton Simon, Deputy Commis
                    sioner of the New York police and head
                    of the department's Narcotic Division.
                    The sudden popularity of marihuana
                    among narcotic addicts was also largely
                    due to the activities of Dr. Simon's
                    staff in cutting off supplies of other
                    drugs. Addicts recognized, too, that
                    they could partake of the new dope in
                    the form of cigarettes with little risk
                    of detection, provided, of course, they
                    aid not take doses strong enough
                    to make them pass into a coma. It is
                    for this same reason, the deputy com
                    missioner believes, that so many re
                    fined and cultured persons are easily
                    tempted to use the cigarettes.
                    No work Is more worthy of the com
                    mendation of all good citizens than
                    that which the police of New York and
                    other large cities are doing to stamp out
                    the drug traffic. It is a task fraught
                    with the greatest difficulties, for the
                    business of dope smuggling is well or
                    ganized and shrewdly managed, and the
                    addicts will run almost any riek to keep
                    supplied with their favorite drug.
                    Although the dore habit is one of the
                    thief vices that make the underworld .-
                    dreadful it is by no means confined to
                    the criminal and derelict classes. In
                    spite of the stringent laws and the
                    eternal vigilance of the police an in
                    creasing number of addicts are being
                    found in the most refined and cultured
                    walk-' of life.
                    A pathetic instance of slavery to drugs rW
                    was revealed in a London police court
                    only a few days ago. Miss Cissie Lo
                    tus, the beautiful and talented actress
                    who has so often appeared in this coun
                    try and been much admired here, was
                    arraigned on a charge of having drugs
                    in her possession. She was released on
                    suspended sentence on her promising to
                    undergo treatment for the habit.
                    Catherine McDonald, a refined and
                    pretty business girl, walked into a New
                    York police station recently and asked
                    to be arrested to prevent her stealing
                    or doing something worse to satisfy
                    her craving for drugs. The story she
                    told threw interesting light on the
                    wicked methods practiced by the "drug
                    drummers."
                    At a dance a few weeks ago she met
                    a "lovely girl" who revealed to her tho
                    magic of a needle that enabled one to
                    dance all night, and by a second injec
                    tion go to work next day as fresh and
                    alert as ever. The needle, as Catherine
                    McDonald later learned, held heroin,
                    ana after six days of its use she found
                    herself unable to get along without
                    regular doses of the drug.</text>

                    Startling Effect of Mexico's Substitute
                    for Tobacco.
                    Tlx- revolution in Mexico has brought
                    with it not only the ravages of war, but
                    also the degradation of the social condi
                    dions of soldiers and prisoners. One of
                    -the latest forms of dissipation in the
                    ranks of federal* and rebels alike is
                    the habit of smoking marihuana, a dead
                    ly native plant of Mexico. According to
                    reports many of the Mexican prisoners
                    in tiie Belem prison in the city of Mexico
                    are losing their minds as u result of
                    smoking this weed.
                    Tiie dry leaves of marihuana, alone or
                    mixed with tobacco, makes the smoker
                    wilder than a wild beast. It is said that
                    .after the first three or four drafts of
                    smoke the smoker feels a slight head
                    ache. then he sees everything moving,
                    and finally loses all control of his mental
                    faculties.
                    The next stage of the intoxication Is
                    full of terrors. Troops of ferocious wild
                    animals march before the vision of the
                    smoker. Lions, tigers, panthers, and
                    other wild beasts occupy his vision.
                    These wild animals are then attacked
                    by hosts of devils and monsters of un
                    heard-of shapes. i tie smoker becomes
                    brave and possessed of superhuman
                    strength. It is at this stage of the de
                    bauch that murders are committed by
                    smokers of the marihuana weed.
                    A few Americans have experimented
                    with the weed. A few years ago a well
                    known citizen of San Antonio purchased
                    a large coffee plantation In southern
                    Mexico, lie was induced to try smoking
                    marihuana; he became adfoted to the
                    lmhlt. which rendered him insane, and
                    finally caused his death.
                    In another instance the superintendent
                    of a mine In Mexico, who was an Ameri
                    can. became tiie object of hatred of one
                    of the men in his employ. The Mexican
                    mixed marihuana with the American’s
                    tobacco. Tiie latter became wildly in
                    sane from smoking the mixture, made a
                    vicious attack upon a party of miners,
                    was shot and killed in the affray.
                    Not long ago a Mexican of the lower
                    I class, living in the City of Mexico, wiio
                    had smoked a marihuana cigarette, be

                <text>WAR ON MARIHUANA SMOKING.
                    Mexican Government Want* to Ex
                    terminate a Weed That Crazes.
                    The effects of smoking the marihu
                    ana weed are so harmful that an ef
                    fort is to be made under direction of
                    the Government to exterminate the
                    plant throughout Mexico. The Mex
                    ican War Department issued orders
                    some time ago prohibiting soldiers
                    from smoking the herb. The Saw
                    against gathering or selling It has
                    been extended to apply to all classes.
                    The consequences of smoking mari
                    huana were shown at Monterey the
                    other day. A friend gave Malquaides
                    Mlreles, a Mexican laborer, a small
                    nu&pty the weed as a Joke and told]
                    him to smoke It. Mlrdes rolled the
                    broken leaf into the form of a cigar*
                    etfca and began smoking it
                    Pleasurable sensations at first
                    passed over him. He had hardly fin
                    ished smoking the cigarette when he
                    was suddenly seized with a fit of
                    Insanity. He made a murderous as
                    sault upon hie wife witn a knife and
                    then stabbed a policeman.
                    Mireles then ran, pursued by a fores
                    of police and other men. He ran for
                    several blocks and then turned and
                    attacked his pursuers. He was knock
                    ed senseless, hound and shut up in a
                    room where he remained until the ef
                    fects of the marihuana had worn off.
                    When be came to he could remember
                    nothing about his actions.
                    A report has been received here
                    from Tuxtla Gutierrez, State of Chia
                    pas, that Jose Solas, a deserter from
                    the Fifteenth Battalion of the army,
                    while under the influence of marihu
                    ana killed Maximo Salasor, a citizen
                    of that place. Solas was violently in
                    sane when he committed the murder.
                    Ho learned to use marihuana while
                    in the army and his uncontrollable
                    desire for the weed led to his deser
                    tion. The murder was done with a
                    knife, Solas walking up to his victim
                    and without a word burying the blade
                    in his body.
                    It is a rare thing for an American
                    to become addicted bo the use of mari
                    huana. One instance of this kind
                    is reported from the city of Oaxaca.
                    A young American located thero
                    several years ago and went into the
                    mining business. He prospered and
                    became wealthy One day while on
                    a hunting trip he was Induced by an
                    old Mexican to smoke a cigarette of
                    marihuana. He found that the sen
                    sations of the poison were indescrib
                    ably delightful.
                    He had smoked perhaps a dozen or
                    more of the cigarettes In as many
                    days, when he was suddenly seized
                    with a fit of Insanity. He broke away
                    from his homo and ran into the moun
                    tains, where ho remained for several
                    hours. The Insanity fit had worn oft
                    ■when ho returned to town.
                    By that time he had become ad
                    dicted to the use of the poison and
                    found It Impossible to give it up. The
                    Insane ©pells came upon him more
                    and more frequently, and in order to
                    prevent himself (from doing violence to
                    someone he always had his servant
                    lock him In a strong room when he
                    felt the first symptoms of the attack.
                    His downfall was rapid. Marihuana
                    brought him to his end In a few
                    months.
                    It is stated by local physicians that
                    the use of marihuana Invariably pro
                    duces a homicidal mania. Many hor
                    rible crimes have been committed by
                    men under its influence.</text>

                    by Mexican peons, has been nicknamed
                    the "gallows plant," writes a'

                    lad and his younger brother were sailing
                    toy boats at a spring. The Mexican
                    without warning killed the youth
                    with a rock. Kirby Bernhard, 11, escaped
                    while his brother was being
                    murdered.

                    while she lay asleep in her bed the
                    afternoon of April 14. For half an i
                    hour after ho had fired three shots i
                    into the girl's body, Cadena stood at
                    the foot of the bed with the smoking
                    revolver in his hand, muttering he had
                    done nothing. Pabiita's sister, paralyzed
                    with horror, witnessed the
                    strange death vigil. When arrested
                    his only explanation in his sworn J
                    statement was, "1 killed her because 1

                    was offered, including that of
                    physicians, to establish that the main
                    effect of smoking the wild weed was
                    to arouse the homicidal instinct. In
                    the Apolinar trial, the defense replied

any motive for the .slaving of the
youth by Apollnar other than the fact
that the Mexican's mind was poisoned
                    by the fumes of the marihuana leaf.
                    Innumerable minor crimes have
                    arisen hero which police ascribe to the
                    use of marihuana. Whenever a strange
                    offense is committed, the officers inquire
                    whether the prisoner is a marihuana
                    smoker.
                    Old officers here say that marihuana
                    has been smoked by Mexicans
                    since time Immemorial. It was first
                    noticed in thi3 immediate locality

                    often employed it as a stimulant while
                    on the warpath.
                    Marihuana is not the well known
                    lceo weed, although sometimes given
                    that name. The leaves, small stems
                    and flowers of the plant are dried,
                    crumbled into pieces like tobacco, and
                    srioked In cigarettes. It strongly resembles
                    green tea when dried.
                    From addicts, it has been learned j
